Hello BSD Now Team!

I heard Tom mention that he runs FreeBSD on his laptop.

Could he please provide the specs of his laptop as well as all the details of his current installation of FreeBSD? Version, Desktop, basic configuration details, etc.

I mostly use MacOS & Linux, but I'm very interested in trying FreeBSD (or one of its derivatives) on a couple of older spare laptops.

Thank you in advance!

Alejandro
