Hi JT, Benedict, Alan and Tom,

Thanks for your continued work on the podcast!

I have a question about memory use on FreeBSD.

top tells me the total amount of active and inactive memory.

top also tells me the amount of resident memory per process.

But how can I find out how much of a process's resident memory is active and how much is inactive?

Thanks,
Karl
