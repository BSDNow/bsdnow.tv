I have a question. I'm listening to episode 500 at the moment. I just listened to the segment about wireguard with AdBlock. How easily can configurations be changed on the server from a device that is being served. In any given case there may be content which is blocked that a user may wish to unblock. This is why I am asking. Thanks so much! -Matt
