Re: Ep. 581 - FreeBSD 13.4 release notes

Love the show as usual.

But...

There is a difference between "deprecated" (as used in the FreeBSD 13.4 release notes) and "depreciated" (as read by Tom).

"Deprecated" describes something that no longer should be used, as it will be phased out in the future.

"Depreciated" describes the reduction in value over time.

Sorry, I couldn't let it pass.
