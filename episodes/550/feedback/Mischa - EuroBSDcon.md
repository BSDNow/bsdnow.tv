Hi Great People of BSDNow!

Was hoping if you could spend some time in one of the next episodes/shows to highlight the CfP for EuroBSDCon 2024 in Dublin, Ireland.
The CfP will most likely open on the 1st of March and will run until the 15th of May.

Any questions please let me know.

Thanx!!

Mischa
