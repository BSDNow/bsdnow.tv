Hi BSD Now team,

You have been a great influence. Listening to the podcast not only did I start using FreeBSD and OpenBSD every day for various projects, I adopted (ported?) BSD-isms to my Linux heavy day job.

400 episodes is a great milestone. Your hard work is appreciated and obviously making an impact. Keep doing the awesome work you are doing.

With thanks from a regular listener.
