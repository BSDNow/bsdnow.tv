In response to Hans regarding dust:

Get a HEPA vac! I used to have 3 cat litter boxes in the same basement room as my server rack. While the HEPA vac sat in front of the rack, it reduced my need to clean from weekly to monthly. Far from perfect but a lot better than nothing.

Also the air that comes out is cooler than ambient so that was a nice bonus!
