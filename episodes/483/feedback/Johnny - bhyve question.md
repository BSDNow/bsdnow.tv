Hi Guys,
  I have a question.  I am running FreeBSD 13.1 laptop.  I am attempting to run the Haiku OS as a guest in Bhyve.  I got it to boot and got to the Haiku OS desktop via vnc however I can't figure out how to get the networking to work for internet access for the Haiku guest OS.  I get mixed messages online.  Most websites say to use a bridge but then they say that you can't build a bridge with a wireless interface.  My laptop uses wlan0 as a wireless interface and it being a laptop it's rarely using the wired interface.  I did find some steps from 2014 freebsd mailing list where Allan posted about setting up nat but I couldn't get that to work either.  Here is the link to that message https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002998.html  I don't know how to tell bhyve to use an ip from 10.0.9.0/24 network.  I attempted to assign the virtio interface in haiku the ip 10.0.9.2 but that still didn't route out to the internet via the nat.  I am attempting to set this up for Haiku OS week that Bryan Lunduke is having at the end of this month.  There is no rules to the week but I would have to use it so I can't really use it without internet access.  In the past I did make Haiku OS work with VirtualBox but I wanted to do something more native.  This is my first project for bhyve and I have been using vmrun.sh script to launch bhyve but that script doesn't give a lot of options.  Any help is very much welcome.

Thanks
