Hello Benedict and Allen!

I just listed to the euroBSDcon episode - as you suspected, while cycling to my office I'm glad to hear you that you enjoyed the social event and the venue. Organizing all that was a lot of work for me, so it means a lot to me that you mentioned my in the podcast. Thanks for the acknowledgment !

Greetings from Amsterdam,
Manuel
