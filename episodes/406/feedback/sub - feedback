hi all,

Would you be able to offer some ideas/guidance on Multi-Booting BSD's (free/open/net).

I currenlty use BSD on nearly all my servers. however i still use linux on my pc and laptop (pop_os!).
I also use raspbian on my PI's but freebsd-13 is about to change that. (successfully testing).

Although there are several apps that i need for work and play that arent as well suported on bsd,  i would like to run the os natively, rather than running desktop vms ontop.

i have a Intel Nuc i5 8gen pc. and a thinkpad t495 ryzen laptop.

Any thoughts would well received, thanks for show, it's perfect listening when walking the dog ..
