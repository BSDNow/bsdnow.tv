Hi Guys,

I'm a long-time listener and fan of the show. My question is about the state of a FreeBSD system during the upgrade process. As I understand it, the steps for a major version upgrade to FreeBSD are as follows:

1. Run freebsd-update -r <version> upgrade
2. Run freebsd-update install
3. Reboot
4. Run freebsd-update install again
5. Reinstall all packages
6. Run freebsd-update install again

Can you describe the state of the system between each of these steps? What should I expect to be working or not working after each step?

Thank you,
Adam
