During a quarterly ports upgrade (Q3), I came across this notice on the package page: https://vuxml.freebsd.org/freebsd/b0a3466f-5efc-11f0-ae84-99047d0a6bcc.html.
The package is affected by two CVEs, but what caught my attention most was this particular note: “Engineers from Apple & Google have proposed patches in the GNOME GitLab issues, but neither has had a fix applied to the git repo since there is currently no maintainer for libxslt.”
That’s quite concerning there are proposed solutions from experienced engineers, yet they remain unmerged due to a lack of active maintainership. Perhaps contributors from companies like Apple and Google should be incentivized, or offered additional support or other donations. The world is going through significant changes, and maybe fewer people have the time or focus to dedicate to open source work. People are understandably thinking more about personal matters these days (though I sincerely hope I'm wrong about that).
That said, I firmly believe BSD is good to supporting. Personally, I humbly donate a small amount every year. It's not much, but it's my way to thx for FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems.
Wishing you all the best thank you for being here, and for keeping this project alive!
Warm regards,
Kylen
