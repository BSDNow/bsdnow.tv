Good morning Allan and Benedict,

Firstly, I am in the Waterloo area and I am sorry that I was not able to make it to the first BSD meetup a few weeks ago.  Scheduled maintenance at work got in the way.

Secondly, I have a question regarding ZFS that I haven't really been able to locate an answer for because I am not sure how to filter out the noise.  I keep reading in places that when ZFS is storing small(er) files, it doesn't bother to calculate the chunks to store across different drives but simply just stores a complete copy of the files on the drives.  What is the thresh hold for this and is it configurable?  Most of my files are not going to fit into this scheme as they are larger files, but I am curious to know what the answer is.

Lastly, any comment on this reddit thread?  https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/fe02o0/the_real_reason_raidzx_is_slower_compared_to_raid/

More specifically in regards to this blog post, https://storagegaga.wordpress.com/tag/redirect-on-write/

Though I am a Linux admin at work, I thoroughly enjoy listening to information regarding the BSD world.

Keep up the great content!
