I somewhat recently transitioned from Linux to OpenBSD and have loved the decision except for one sticking point. rStudio has been an integral part of my workflow and doesn't appear to be available on OpenBSD. Is there any options or workarounds that you're aware of to get this up and running?

Best,

Luke
