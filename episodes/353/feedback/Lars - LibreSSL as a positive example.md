Hi,

Thanks for the consistently interesting and informative shows.  I notice
that books are mentioned fairly often.  Perhaps when you are out and
mingling with other developers you can ask them to verify this following
item.  Some of them are bound to have this book or have read it:

Code from the OpenBSD project's LibreSSL is used as a positive example
in "Serious Cryptography: A Practical Introduction to Modern Encryption"
(2017) by Jean-Philippe Aumasson [1] published by No Starch Press.
Specifically on pages 30 and 31 it is used to show a safer way to use
/dev/urandom.  It's an indication that the subject, coding style, and
code quality from OpenBSD is having a positive impact far outside the
OpenBSD project itself.
