Hi, Allan, Benedict, and JT...

Would love to get an analysis and commentary on this issue that's affecting some (but not all) of my FreeBSD systems for the past week now.  I tried to follow the bug thread, but it's still not clear to me what happened, where the issue lives (is it local or remote code that needs updating?), what the fix is, and what we users are supposed to do about it. It sounds like it could be weeks until we can use pkg again. A concise and clear distillation would be most appreciated!

As always, thanks for your expertise.
