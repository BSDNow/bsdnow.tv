I finally listened to episode 404 (sorry im behind), and I have to say that was the greatest Tarsnap ad I think I've ever heard.  JT genuinely got a laugh out of me for that one, and speaking as a Canadian myself, We still remember the when the US tried to invade us during the Napoleonic Wars, so he's right to fear our retaliation. 
Thanks for the great show guys, keep up the fantastic work.
