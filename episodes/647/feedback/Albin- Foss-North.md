Hi!

I'm on the crew of Foss-North, a non-profit open source conference 
taking place in Gothenburg, Sweden on April 27--28 2026. Our CfP is 
currently open, and will be until February 15th. You will be able to 
find all the necessary info on our website, 
https://foss-north.se/2026/. We're able to cover travel expenses up to 
300 EUR, but sadly nothing more. We're wondering if you could give us a 
mention in the pod? We would be very thankful! And as the sole BSD user 
on the crew, I would be happy to have some BSD stuff mixed in between 
all the Linux stuff!

And we are also looking for sponsors, so if you could also mention that 
we would be very thankful!

Thank you for all the work you put into the episode!

Regards,
Albin Otterhäll
