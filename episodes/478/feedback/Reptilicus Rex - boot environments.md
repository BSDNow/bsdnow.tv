I'm interested in the technical differences between FreeBSD's boot environments and the Linux way of accomplishing what seemingly is a similar concept through BTRFS subvolumes.

More specifically, at a technical level, how does a rollback to a FreeBSD BE compare to a rollback to a BTRFS snapshot done through snapper etc.

I just want to know and am not interested in starting a flamewar about which is better. There's probably pros and cons to both and maybe that can be discussed.

If possible, please devote some time to this on an upcoming show.

I've been a listener since Mr. Moore was one of the hosts. Thank you for the effort over the several years.
