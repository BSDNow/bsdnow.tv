I am trying to get FreeBSD up and running with a gui so I followed the instructions from the 0-to-bhyve article on klarasystems.com (including the part about installing my gpu driver) but it doesn't seem to work. GDM isn't working or something else is wrong. 

I need more help getting it running but I can't seem to figure it out. The handbook doesn't seem to be very clear since it looks like it tries to explain the process for ports mostly and not pkg(s). 

It has been a really long time since I last used a desktop environment on FreeBSD. I think the last time I had a FreeBSD desktop was back when PC-BSD was a thing. 

I have also tried GhostBSD but it has similar issues. It can't get going with a GUI.
