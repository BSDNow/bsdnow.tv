Hi Benedict and Allan - I've been looking at some firewalling needs and rather than going immediately to commercial off the shelf solutions I thought I would look at some BSD options as well. I don't need a bunch of the fancy next gen features often sold. I just need basic layer 3/4 firewalling and IDS/IPS abilities. Throughput is not my biggest issue though rather I need a lot of connections. Ideally I would need a box that could do about 4 million connections without rolling over and degrading performance. I looked around some and saw a few references to how to do things like limit connection counts and similar but nothing that really discussed sizing a system to reach different throughput or connection limits. I hoped you might have some recommendations on good resources for building a solution on one of the BSDs and sizing the hardware to match the performance mentioned earlier. Love listening to the show and appreciate your thoughts. - Rob
