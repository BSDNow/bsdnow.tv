I've been enjoying the show thank you for the effort and keep up the good work.  I'd like to submit a question:
I'm a huge fan of ZFS  I have a set of spinning rust drives on which I keep my data and then SSDs have become cheap enough that I have a 1TB SSD for the OS.  As 13 has just come out I'm looking at upgrade strategies.  I've been considering boot environments but I'm not really sure they're exactly what I'm looking for.  I get the sense that, other than the root partition, boot environments reuses some of your existing partitions.  It snapshots the root first and then clones it to a new filesystem and installs over that.  If you have files that don't get overwritten by an install they stick around either because they're on the root which gets overwritten or on a partition that get's reused.  That's great but I'd rather erase and start from scratch each time.  Then copy over what I need from the old install.  I don't need to figure out what isn't needed anymore but is just left over from a previous install.  When disk starts to get tight  after a few install's I will just go and delete the oldest install.  SSDs are so large and cheap that I have plenty of space to do that.  Is there way to do this using boot environments or perhaps it's easy without boot environments?  Curious what thoughts you might have on the matter.
