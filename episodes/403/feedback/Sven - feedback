Hi, everyone. I love the show and learn a lot from it. I run OpenBSD on all my servers and workstations. For wireless, I have been using commercial hardware, but after Ubiquiti's recent data breaches and coverups, I decided to switch my wireless to FreeBSD if possible. As far as I know, OpenBSD can't run multiple SSIDs, but I'm hoping FreeBSD can. FreeBSD was very easy to set up on a PcEngines APU2 and I have one wireless network set up, but haven't figured out multiple SSIDs yet. I've been intrigued by your discussions of ZFS so I have a simple ZFS stripe on it and plan to learn more. For the future I hope I can have FreeBSD for all my wireless access points while keeping all my other equipment on OpenBSD. Thanks!
