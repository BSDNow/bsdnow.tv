Hello Tom, Allan, Benedict, and JT squared!
A question that came up at the last NYCBUG  meeting:
Has anyone gotten one of those low end generic 3D printers going on a *BSD?
We had a member who is well versed in rolling their own software and is no technical slouch but was bedeviled with problems getting a low end 3D printer up and running. They asked at the meeting if anyone in the group had any luck with such a device, and I wanted to throw the question to a wider audience. Seems the unit is full of generic controller chips that low end devices use, think $12 single board Items you find on AliExpress, Amazon, etc, and had some support via different Linux distros, but little to no support on the *BSDs. Regarding the chips, they said: these low end chips are so ubiquitous, there and probably 10 of them in this bar right now, controlling all sorts of stuff. Sorry, I have no more details like model numbers and this question is second hand, but I thought something may come of the asking. Hope you are all well. 

Patrick
