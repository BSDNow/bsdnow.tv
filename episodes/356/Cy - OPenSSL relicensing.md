Hi!  I was wondering if there have been any updates in the last couple years about the OpenSSL re-licensing effort?  The last related posting on the OpenSSL website appears to be from 2018 (https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/03/01/last-license/) Has the switch to Apache licensing stalled out?  I recall this change being a serious concern for the LibreSSL project when originally announced, as it would preclude their importing any OpenSSL changes going forward, so it would be nice to hear about any community plans on how to deal with that situation if it does come to pass.
