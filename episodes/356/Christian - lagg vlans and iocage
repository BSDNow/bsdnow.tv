Hi Allan and Benedict,

after listening to your podcast for a few years and hear your begging for questions all the time I decided to send one to you.

I have a Unifi network at home and a FreeBSD server in the basement. It has two nics (igb0 and igb1). I splitted my network to several VLANs.

I would like to assign the iocage jails to different vlans in my network and group the nics with lagg. But I'm struggeling to get it working.

I bricked my network access several times while trying to get the lagg working.

And I can't find any good information on how to assign the iocage jails to my vlans.

Do you have any advice for me?

Best regards
Chris
