First of all, I wanted to say that I really enjoyed having JT on the show recently while Allan was absent. I hope you have him participate more frequently in the future.

I was wondering if you could give some information about FreeBSD and powerd ir powerd++. Does Intel Turbo Boost work automatically, or does it need additional configuration in software or the BIOS? How can I test to ensure it is working as expected?

What support does FreeBSD have for temperature sensing and fan control? I read that OpenBSD's sensors framework was ported to FreeBSD as a GSoC project a few years ago, but I couldn't find anything about any parts of FreeBSD actually using it.

Thank you so much for the show. Keep up the good work.
