Do you consider the use of ZFS on a laptop to be save when using suspend-to-RAM?

Because during my tests some time ago I remember seeing some messages concerning nvme0 on resume, though I can't quite recall what they were all about (something about resubmitting queued I/O and a WRITE, on another occasion some more messages).
