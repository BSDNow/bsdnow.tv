  Hi BSD Crew,

   In September, will be done in Sintra (Portugal) an event to
celebrate the Software Freedom Day.

   So far, we are only Penguins, but we also would like to invite, at
least, the Portuguese Beasties, but we can not find active BSD User
Groups in Portugal. Do you know if there are some?

   Cheers,
    Filipe
