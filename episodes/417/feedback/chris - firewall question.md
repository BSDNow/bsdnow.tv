Hey guys.  Thanks as always for the show.  I have a question about BSD firewalls.  In iptables there's a function called "mangle" which is for altering packet contents as they go through the firewall.  In my case I'm using it to adjust the TTL to bypass tethering restrictions on my cell phone. (I'm in rural Missouri, and my options are nearly non-existent.)  Is there a way to do this in either pf or ipfw?  I can set the default TTL for the machine the firewall is running on, but this doesn't seem to affect firewall traffic. Thanks again, and I hope you both are well.  --chris
