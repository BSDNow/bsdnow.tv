You guys do a tremendous service to the BSD community with the
videocasts and podcasts.  I've been watching/listening to BSDNow
starting with about episode 75, and have many times followed up news
that you report on, and also learned about new offshoots in the BSD
family for which I've built virtual machines (now more than 600, of
which about 200 are running at any given time, on 8 or more physical
servers, with 2 new Dell PowerEdge R6515 boxes soon to be put into VM
server use.).  

We have also just opened up access to a new large memory system: 6TB
DRAM in a Dell PowerEdge R840 (4 CPUs, 96 cores, 192 threads, 2400
MHz, Intel Xeon Platinum 8260L), intended to support large memory
needs in computer algebra calculations.

We have five other systems with 1TB DRAM each, but only one of those
is accessible to all users in our department.
