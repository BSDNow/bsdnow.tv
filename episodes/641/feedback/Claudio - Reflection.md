Greetings, BSD Now /etc/hosts!

Been a silent listener since the early days with Allan Jude and Kris
Moore, and I've always enjoyed the podcast since the very beginning
and through all of the host changes. I remember when Benedict started
as host on the show and how nervous he sounded, but as time passed, he
got his footing and really took lead of the show. While it's sad to
see him go for now, I do wish him all the best in this new path and
hope to hear him back on the show soon as a guest host or even as an
interviewee. For now, I'll have to settle with seeing his MOTD
comments after I log into my FreeBSD box. :-)

And I also want to give a big welcome to Ruben Schade (whose last name
I always pronounced the German way, lol), whom I follow on Mastodon. I
know he's going to be a great addition to the show and look forward to
his NetBSD perspective on the show!
