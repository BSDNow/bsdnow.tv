Hey Folks,

We are delighted to announce our first meeting for 2021!
On January 6th at 18:45 EST (23:45 UTC) NYC*Bug will host a Zoom
meeting entitled:

Chatting About TLS and Orcs, by Michael W. Lucas

Mr. Lucas will be doing some readings from his forthcoming book on
TLS. We promise that this meeting will be entertaining, although
NYC*BUG can make no assurances about the accuracy of the data. And
while his jokes will likely drop like lead zeppelins, we are convinced
you will be at least entertained.

For Zoom meeting details, email to rsvp AT lists.nycbug.org, and
details will be sent on the day of the meeting.


As with our successful December meeting entitled:
For the Love of Troff, by James K. Lowden
We be fielding questions over IRC at  #nycbug on Freenode

Wishing you all a safe and socially distanced Holiday season and
fantastic 2021 from all of us at NYC*Bug!

*JT, Allan, and Benedict, I wish you a very happy and safe holiday
season and thank you very much for all your work on your very
informative and enjoyable podcast.
