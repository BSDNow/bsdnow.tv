Hi guys!  As long as I can remember, shared library names have used a .so suffix and static libraries have used a .a suffix.  I was wondering, do you know what the origin of that naming convention is?  Is there some ISO standard somewhere that calls it out, or is it just an informal convention from the early days that carried through?

Cheers, and thanks for a very interesting show!
