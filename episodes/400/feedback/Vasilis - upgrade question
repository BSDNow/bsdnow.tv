Hi Allan, Benedict & JT,
I hope you are doing well!
Because of your show and MWL's  Absolute FreeBSD I started my *BSD journey and joined this wonderful community. Thank you for the great show!

In the Summer, I set up a computer with an AMD APU 3200G and as a newbie I run 12.2 Release.
I look forward to installing 13.0 Release as it includes the AMDGPU drivers that will give me full functionality of the GPU component.
My system has an SSD as zroot and two Iron-wolves as a zfs mirror pool for my data files.
I haven't updated the pools to zfs 2.0 yet.

My question is,
In order to properly upgrade the system without messing the pool,
shall I do # zfs export mypool before I install the new system
and after the installation run # zfs import mypool ?

I don't have tarnsnap backups yet and I don't want to lose the data in the zfs mirror pool.
Thank you so much for your time and effort.

I hope we will manage to handle the situation soon and be able to meet in person in BSDCan.

Best,
Vasilis
