Hello:

Thank you for the wonderful podcasts that you guys make. I found the bsd restoration project to be very interesting.  My concern is, do you have an archive of past podcasts for listening or download? I was looking to see whether you have something in your archive, that I may want to listen to. Thank you very much. Have a nice day and continue the awesome work you do.
