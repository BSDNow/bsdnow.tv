Hi, Tom, Allan, Benedict, and JT! I love the show. Just a quick note re episode 481 and the article about Postgresql on OpenBSD. Instead of building Postgres from source, running OpenBSD -current provides the most recent packages. I've run -current in production for years and have had perhaps one or two minor, temporary problems at the very most. I keep some machines a few versions behind just for safety. There are no guarantees on -current, but in practice, it just works, for me at least. I use custom-written client management software with Postgresql as a backend. The perl frontend also lets me send bills and collect payments and send messages using APIs for the various external services I have to use.

Thanks again for a great show -- I learn so much from you and really enjoy each episode.
