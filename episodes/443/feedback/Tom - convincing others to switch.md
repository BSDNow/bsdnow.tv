Hi BSD Now,

  I've been a listener for a while and really enjoy your podcast.
Thanks for making this great podcast!

My day job is Linux Systems Administrator for a Web development 
company. In my free time I contribute to the OpenBSD project
(I'm a maintainer for a handful of ports.)

I have a pretty big question:

What would be the best way to convince my directors at work that a
switch to FreeBSD from Linux would be really beneficial for
the web environment? What could I tout? ZFS? Jails? Perhaps
using Capiscum for PHP (if that's even possible?)

We do a lot of Agile deployments. Something like zfs snapshots
would be great to to do prior t a deployment in case anything fails.

What are some things I can tell them that would really sell FreeBSD
as a technicaly superior OS to Linux in this arena?

Many thanks and keep up the fantastic work on BSD Now!

-Tom
