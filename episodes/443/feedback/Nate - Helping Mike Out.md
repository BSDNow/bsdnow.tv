Love the show folks, keep up the great work!  In regards to Mike's feedback in Episode 439 (GhostBSD in a VM), I used the following link to successfully setup a GhostBSD VM on my Fedora workstation running KVM/QEMU:

There is a section detailing the setup of the evdev xorg driver and utouch driver, both of which got the mouse/pointer situation working for me on my setup. 

Hope that helps Mike out.  Thanks again for the great show!
