Listening to episode 435, I found the part about shell communities particularly interesting.  A shell community that went unmentioned was Grex (www[.]cyberspace[.]org), and I think it's particularly notable in a BSD context because it's been running on OpenBSD since 2004 after switching from a customized version of SunOS.  (See hxxp[://]www[.]cyberspace[.]org/faq[.]xhtml#whatrun)
