I like what Tom did with the maker space host naming convention. I threatened to do that at work, where we use mountains. For users that really annoy me, I have threatened to "use a volcano name in Iceland. You know, 37 characters, 1 vowel." Got the stinkeye from my boss...

Wanted to share this with you. A friend sent me the link yesterday, and I saw it before I had had my coffee. I opened it with some trepidation, but as I read the post, a big grin creased my face, and I went to the kitchen to brew coffee with a spring in my step.

Hey BSD Now crew,

I have a two-prong problem with Bhyve, and I'm hoping this is something within your wheelhouse.

I have been going back and forth trying to find a definitive guide to setting up bhyve, especially the networking. I have seen guides online that say to set up bhyve networking through ifconfig, setting up a bridge, while others say to use vm switch create, and I haven't seen the best way to do. I posted a couple of questions to the FreeBSD forums, and again, got no definitive answers.

Part of the problem is my particular use case. My hardware is a Lenovo M710q tiny server, that has a single interface. The first thing I am looking to do is to complete a project I am working on, upgrading my firewall from pfSense to OPNsense. However, my firewall has 3 interfaces. So not only have I not been able to work out how basic networking works, let alone whether I can set up a VM with three interfaces, two of them being on, to use a term electronics and RF communications, a dummy load.

The OPNsense VM is not a permanent solution, just to convert the config from pf to opn, and maybe a bit of sanity testing.

Can you all point me to some resources?

Thanks,
