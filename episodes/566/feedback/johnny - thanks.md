Hi All,
  It's been a while since I last wrote in so here it goes. I really enjoyed this weeks episode 562. Mr. Benedict you did wonderful. I enjoyed your segment on Syncthing and Paperless-ngx.  I find them both very interesting and informative. I tend to scan all my important docs as a backup but I don't normally OCR them so using syncthing and paperless-ngx together this could be a nice solution. Anyway thanks again for a wonderful show.

Thanks,
Johnny
