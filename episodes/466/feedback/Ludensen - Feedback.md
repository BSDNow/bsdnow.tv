Hi Benedict, Allan, Tom and JT,

Thank you so much for a great and informative show!

Today the diversity of available computers are going up - ARM, RISC-V and others are mixing in with AMD64/i386-architecture.

and of course we all want to run BSD on every single one of our devices, if possible (like the BSD TP-link router project).

But the support for the BSD's are often scant, so as a community we mainly have to rely on dedicated community-members putting together a working image for a device - and them sharing it.
- and luckily there are many such dedicated members!

But the level of information and source coming with those images vary greatly from absolutely nothing to a full Github-repo.

I would like to hear your discussion and opinions on how much information YOU as a person need to trust and use a new BSD-image?
- or from what kind of member in the community?


Looking forward to an informative discussion on the show 

Kind regards
the paranoid noob
