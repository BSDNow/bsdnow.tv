Tom,
I have one regarding kTLS and it's real world usability for end users. Is it only useful for people with 100Gbit NICs for like $1000+? Is there a reason why it's still not enabled by default (at least openssl side in base system, where WITH_OPENSSL_KTLS=1 is required in src.conf). Is it even worth playing with for slower 10G networks? Does it affect only throughput or also latency? I did Nginx build with that feature enabled, but it's hard to find any info about how to even configure that (except obvious - enabling sendfile and picking supported cipher)â€¦
