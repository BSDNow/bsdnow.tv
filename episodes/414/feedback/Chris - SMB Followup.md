Hi Allan, Benedict, et al. 

I thought I would follow up on my mysterious SMB connectivity issue that would randomly come and go. It seems it wasn't an issue with Mac OS or TrueNAS. It was a setting on my ExpressVPN software. Whenever I had "Stop all internet traffic if the VPN disconnects..." selected, it would interfere with my LAN traffic even though I had the other option selected to "Allow access to devices on the local network...". I reported it to tech support and they are the ones that had me uncheck these options. 

Now that these options are deselected, my connection works 100% of the time and the traffic is noticeably faster!

Keep up the great work guys. Love your show!

Chris
