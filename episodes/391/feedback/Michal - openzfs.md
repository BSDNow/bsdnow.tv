Hello.
I love your podcasts. Really great job. Thanks.
For feedback and questions I have a question about openzfs and freebsd.
Openzfs has a feature for native encryption dataset or pool. And in fbsd 13 it works beautiful.
But I want to ask you if is it possible for using native encryption for root zfs? For example for a whole pool.

with best regards
