Hi all,

The Show is greatly appreciated, long live BSD Now, Love the Show. As a listener to the BSD Now program  for some time and having heard the many request for Questions. . .  Well here goes.

In the process of cleaning our storage at work i came across a Supermicro Motherboard Mod X11SSH-CTF-0 slated for disposal. Suffice is to say could not bring myself to trash it, instead decided to save it and some how set up a dedicated BSD or True OS lab. This could serve as my BSD/TrueOS media lab with Ravenna/AES67 IP network audio hardware, in conjunction with Blackmagic Hardware and software. Not to overlook Z Cam .

Well  it turns out it was a good decision, as a quick visit to Suprtmicro showed the board to be well provisioned, needing only a CPU, Memory and a Case, which i have.  Though the X11SSH-CTF-0 is close to 3 years old, it could function nicely as a Media Workstation and near line storage server.

My Questions are.

How well would this X11SSH-CTF-0 Motherboard function in the applications described above.

As the workstation will be used to Capture, Edit and Convert both High resolution audio and video media files. Which CPU will serve best for these applications.

Are there any plans, or is anyone working on makeing BSD  IP audio friendly, handleing AES67, Ravenna or Livewire, IP Network audio. This would be quite useful in BSD / TrueOS, giving it a distinct advantage in many ways. As am not a programmer how can one contribute to make BSD Network audio freindly and where does one start.

Here is a starting point for a couple American IP standards and Manufacturers AES 67 Audio Engineering Society  (mostly ravenna based). Axia Livewire IP Audio networking (used widely in Broadcast), (which is almost fully compatible with Ravenna, except fo clocking, which is easily corrected). On hardware see: -  Comrex (Ravenna/AES6.  Axia, Telos Alliance etc using Livewire. . . Note DANTE is also an American Standard, however tis Propritory.

Met thinks, the ters of licensing of both AES67 and Ravenna should be somewhat compatible with the BSD's. Failure to Include these resources in the BSD OS's (in my opinion) could be considered a significant handicap. . . Please advise.

Having spent some time serving in the media industry, mostly in a technical capacity handling installation, maintenance, live events etc. and observed the now irreversible trend to IP networked media transport that has permeated all of communications, spanning both audio and video, handling Multi channel audio, multi camera Video, live recording and Entertainment  events etc. all on IP.

The installation  of Fiber and 100GB networking on Mellanox switches at my X job now completed, was essential to handle and future proof  the Networked multi Studio and Performance spaces supporting multi channel and camera Audio and Video feeds. The sourceing, capture and routing equipment complement include  Blackmagic, Panasonic and Sony with Video SDI, HD - 4K and 6K and audio sample rates spanning 44.1K - 384KHz with 24bit. Along with (Direct Stream Digital) audio spanning DSD64, DXD128 - 256KHz. These trends are industry wide covering Installed Sound / Video, for  hotels, Stadiums, theaters, Live Concert Events, Broadcast Radio / TV, Remote  recording, Private studios and Podcasting etc.
