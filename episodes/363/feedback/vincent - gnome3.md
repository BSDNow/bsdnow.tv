The official FreeBSD web page for Gnome3 https://www.freebsd.org/gnome/ was last updated on 14 February 2016 when there was an announcement for v3.18 . As of July 2020, Freshports shows that v3.28 is in ports, which was last updated in August 2019. The last Gnome3 release announcement was for v3.36. The FreeBSD port is lagging four releases behind the current Gnome3 release. I was wondering if this particular FreeBSD project had quietly died. I wouldn't be surprised if it had because Gnome3 appears to be more tightly coupled to systemd/Linux with each new version. I think it is time for me to pick a new desktop environment.
