Hi Allan and Benedikt,

I have a third way if the lister is looking a router style device. I would usually approach this by getting a machine with one or two 10GbE or SFP+ ports with a managed switch in front. A 10G PCI card is about the same price as buying several 1G cards by now. It's probably treturouse to mention but Mikrotik do some extremely competitive 1GbE switches with SFP+ ports for uplink to a router or other switch. Depends on routing/firewall complexity desired but x86 is still likely the best price to performance as there is a significant gulf between consumer arm stuff and the server grade that skips this kind of small to medium scale application.


At home I'm happy enough with a pcengines APU Board running OpenBSD as a gateway/router device. Only 3 1GbE ports but as I don't have space for a rack at home I don't need much more.

Happy hacking,
