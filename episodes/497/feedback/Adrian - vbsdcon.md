Hi, Benedict, Allen,

I believe I got to meet both of you at VBSDcon the last time it was held way back in 2019. It’s held on odd years and 2021 didn’t happen for reasons we don’t need to get into.

Do either of you know if VBSDcon will be back for 2023?

It’s a great conference. Always a lot of fun. Since it is always in northern Virginia, it’s driving distance, inexpensive and dearly missed.

Keep the great shows coming! As an old timer that gets paid for what I learned using BSD, but not to work on BSD, they are my connection what’s happening in the greater BSD community. 

Thanks!

Adrian
