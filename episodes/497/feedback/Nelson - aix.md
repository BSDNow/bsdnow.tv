The TUHS list today has a long
stream of letters about the
moving of AIX to maintenance mode.  A good bit of the discussion touches on FreeBSD
and other members of the BSD family, and thus might be worth a note on the BSD Now podcast.  Archives are at https://www.tuhs.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/tuhs@tuhs.org/.

Thanks for keeping this excellent podcast going!
