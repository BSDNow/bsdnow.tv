Hi Lads,
I am one of the Janitors over at Hacker Public Radio, and I just wanted to say thanks for the feature on https://www.bsdnow.tv/471. Our host binrc, has been doing his best to convert us all to BSD.
I would like to return the favor and include a sample episode of BSD Now on the HPR feed to our 33.5K unique monthly subscribers. While we don't syndicate content on HPR we do release sample shows of Creative Commons podcasts for our audience, with instructions to their websites, and feeds etc. We also have a sister site Free Culture Podcasts, that we use as an umbrella project to promote everyone's podcasts when we attend events around the world. If this is something you are interested in just let me know.
To answer some points in your show, we started producing shows nearly 17 years ago, and all 4236 of the shows produced have been contributed by the listeners themselves. You asked how we know the shows content is accurate, given we do not vet, edit, moderate or in any way censor any of the audio people submit[1] . Well if someone has a correction or clarification to any show then they can comment, or record a show themselves.
As we are dedicated to sharing knowledge needless to say BSD, has been featured more than once[2]. So if you or any of your listeners want to submit a show then just record a show and upload it, so long as it's released under a Creative Commons license and is of interest to Hackers.
Thanks again for the feature and if you want me to come on and waffle about HPR I'd be more than happy to do so.
