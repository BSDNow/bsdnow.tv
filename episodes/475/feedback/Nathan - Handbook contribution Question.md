I found a few things in the FreeBSD Developers' Handbook that need updating. A link on the page says, "Edit this page", so I clicked it, hoping perhaps for a wiki. It took me to a GitHub page that says, "You need to fork this repository to propose changes." Do they accept contributions by any other means?
