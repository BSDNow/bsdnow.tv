Hi BSD Now crew,

Long time listener since episode one. I have you guys to thank for me getting into BSD. I have generally settled on OpenBSD for server and desktop. Also started using FreeBSD on the server and want to start using it on the desktop. However on the FreeBSD native TTY such as on bare metal or in virtual box, the backspace key does not work correctly in Emacs, mg, and editors based on it. Instead it sent control H. I like vi, neovim, and ee, editors which donâ€™t have this problem. But I also want to use Emacs and mg on FreeBSD. Problem does not happen when SSHing to a FreeBSD server from anything other than FreeBSD. what can I do to correct this?

Thanks and keep up with the great show.
Kevin
