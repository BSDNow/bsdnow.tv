I recently submitted a documentation bug to bugs.freebsd.org

My suggestion to bsdnow is to do a short segment on the process of resolving documentation bugs.

Here's one example that reads like it was resolved but alas not merged:

https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=243209

Here's an example I submitted that was promptly marked as duplicate (and rightly so) ...

https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=275771

Here's one reported in fixed in about a day ...
