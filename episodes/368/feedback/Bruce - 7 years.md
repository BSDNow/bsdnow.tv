Hi Benedict, Allen, and JT,
Congrats on your upcoming 7 year reunion of BSDnow!   I watched the live feed today and you should get a quick interview with Kris Moore's 7 year-old and see what he says about computers.

Looks like since there was only the latest 119 episodes of BSDnow, it says it was 2018 when the first episode aired. (I thought you might want to fix that).

Episode Archive
119 episodes of BSD Now since the first episode, which aired on March 29th, 2018.
Keep up the good work!

p.s. I was planning on helping out of Saturday for the BugBustingOfficeHours.  I did not know what I could do to prepare to help with documentation (because I am a sysadmin and only use BASH to create scripts and not do real programming).
