Hi, Tom, Allan, Benedict, and JT,

Currently if I search any of the Google services for the string "BSD" I
might or might not find much if anything even remotely relevant to any
of the BSDs, this goes double for YouTube.  That has been the situation
for a long while now.  Way back before Google dropped the "Don't Be
Evil" motto, it used to have a specialized search interface to help find
and promote material /about/ BSD [1].  The address used to be this:

 https://google.com/bsd/

It has sadly been gone for a very long time:

 https://web.archive.org/web/20100412103546/https://google.com/bsd/

Whatever happened to it and why?  I presume there is both an official
explanation from them as well very different story of what really went
on there.

Anyway, now that it's gone, what search engine alternatives currently
exist to easily find actual BSD-related material, especially recorded
video talks and presentations?
