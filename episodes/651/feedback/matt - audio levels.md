Hey guys! I noticed in the latest episode that the audio levels of one of your guests was off the charts loud! Anyway, I was wanting to know how you mix your audio and if I maybe could be of any assistance. I do really like working with audio.

Anyway, if this is unwelcome help feel free to tell me. I don't want to be in any way offensive in my request. 

Thanks!
