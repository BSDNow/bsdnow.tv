 
Hello BSDNow crew, I'm sending this via email directly so I can have copies of the messages I send to you guys.
Regardless, I have a question that may involve some speculation on your parts but I'd love to hear a response nevertheless.

You've talked about on this show about how Sony uses FreeBSD, specifically version 9, in their Playstation 4 console. With that and the long ago EOL of 9 acknowledged; Does this mean that Sony maintains their own build of FreeBSD 9 continuously updated for security and library updates? What kind of maintenance burden would that entail?
Thanks for the good show and have a good day,
Thank you.
