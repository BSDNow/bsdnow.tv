BSD Now crew,

I've been a fan for a while, since way before you went under linux academy.  I've stayed a regular listener as I work my way over to BSD as my primary computer. 

I don't need to see you guys, but occassionally when you are referencing a website or something, it would be nice to have a video to look at. I haven't found video anywhere for BSD now which used to just be on youtube. 

Is there a way I can pay for video? or do you just not do that anymore? I remember looking around when the videos stopped on youtube, and I don't think I ever heard you guys on air say that you weren't doing video anymore... So I'm confused.

In any case, I love the show, I've learned a ton, and I'll continue to support you video or not.

I will be sending technical questions in the future, but right now I'm busy with graduate school.

Thanks,
Hassan
