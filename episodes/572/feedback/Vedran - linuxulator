Hello,

Thanks to Gleb Popov's work to bring Rocky Linux 9 to Linuxulator that landed in Ports last month, it is again possible to run Visual Studio Code Remote over SSH on FreeBSD. I documented my experience with configuring it on my blog:

I hope you would find this interesting and would appreciate if you could feature this post on a future episode of your show.

With best regards,
Vedran Miletic
