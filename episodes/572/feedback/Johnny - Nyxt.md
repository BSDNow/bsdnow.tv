Hi Guys,
  I was looking for the port for the Nyxt web browser. It seems to be MIA.  Maybe it was never committed.  I can't find it in the git history either.  Anyway I found this FreeBSD Journal article on using Git to contribute to ports by Joseph Mingrone https://freebsdfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/mingrone_revised.pdf from 2022 but none of the links in the document are live.  Maybe you guys know Joseph and could ask him to revise the doc and fix the links?  Maybe I can pickup where he left off with the Nyxt port?  There is a few more ports I would like to contribute too but I always git lost in the makefile details it's a bit complex.

Love The Show,
Johnny
