Dear bsdnow Team,
Perfect show as always!
I was wondering if you can help on how to get the initial command for a pipe or queue creation? When a standard ipfw rule is executed one can view it with:
ipfw show
or
ipfw list
When a pipe or queue is created ipfw or dnctl returns only details about the status of the pipe or the queue but not the command that was actually used to create them.

With best regards,

Lyubomir
