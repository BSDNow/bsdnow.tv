Hi, Benedict, Allan, and Tom! Thanks for the great show and your kind words about my OpenBSD "dog garage" article in undeadly.org. I'm intrigued by the possibility of presenting it at the conference, but unfortunately I won't be able to this time around. I am submitting another article to undeadly though with a canine/OpenBSD theme. On a FreeBSD note, I think I "almost" have multiple access points working. I can see two networks that I create, but still can only log into one of them. I see the relevant section now in man rc.conf but I am still doing something bone-headed no doubt. I'm running FreeBSD 12.2-RELEASE-p6 on a PcEngines APU2 with ath0 (AR9280) wifi. I create two wlan interfaces and two hostapd-wlan_x.conf files and there are two hostapd processes running, one for each file, but hostapd_cli all_sta only shows one interface. I notice man hostapd mentions "hostapd_cli reconfigure" but that doesn't seem to be one of the options in hostapd_cli. I will keep "chipping" away at it, and hope to hear if someone finds a solution as well. Thanks again for a great podcast!!
