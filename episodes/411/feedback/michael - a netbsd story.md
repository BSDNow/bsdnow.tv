Hey BSD Now crew, good to see you guys are growing. Not a question, just another submission. I was looking at my regular news feeds and have been seeing a lot of NetBSD stories, not sure whats inspiring it but its always great to see as I have started using it some since I started listening to the show from like 2013. This was the one I saw earlier today, would be good to see what you all have to say about it 
Thanks

Producers Note:
I've removed the link and we're saving it for a future episode.  So all you listeners will just have to keep tuning in so we dont spoil it for you - JT
