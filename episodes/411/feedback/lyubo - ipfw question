Hi Alan, Benedict, Tom and JT,
Nice show as always and it is good to see Tom joining the team!
I would like to ask a networking question about IPFW/PF. How do you manage traffic shaping and how scalable is it? Up to what traffic volumes and up to what amount of sessions (supposing pure routing, NAT not involved) can one scale?
Thanks for the answer in advance and keep on running the show!

Regards,

Lyubo
