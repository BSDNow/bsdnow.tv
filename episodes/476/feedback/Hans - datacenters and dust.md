Hi Allan, Benedict, Tom and JT,

I heard you asking for more questions. I have one non-BSD, I hope that's OK...

I think at least two of you have dedicated rooms in your house for you servers. I have it too. I think it's safe to say that these rooms are semi-professional datacenters since they are equipped by both industrial equipment (servers) and non-industrial equipment (aircon).

How do you deal with dust in your datacenters? Do you use any non-industrial or DIY equipment to filter air and catch dust?

Dust is the only thing that I can't figure out in my home datacenter. I've seen servers that are running for years in real datacenters and they're completely clean inside. But in my case they look almost like PCs running under office desks. They are not as bad since rack cases are generally cleaner inside due better construction but they're definitely not clean either.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

Hans
