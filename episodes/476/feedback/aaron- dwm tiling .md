Hi Allan,
in a recent episode, if I understood you correctly, you critisized the dwm tiling window manager and suckless projects in general because of their coding style that undermines the "solidity" of their programs. I would like to ask you what you think of xmonad. I recently moved to xmonad from dwm. I liked dwm but wanted to customize it for my specific needs and since I have recently started studying Haskell xmonad seemed like a perfect choice. If your opinion happens to be negative for xmonad as well could you please point out a similar dynamic tiling window manager that you consider "solid"?
Ps. These episodes are awesome. Thanks for the awesome work you guys do.
Kind regards,
Aaron
