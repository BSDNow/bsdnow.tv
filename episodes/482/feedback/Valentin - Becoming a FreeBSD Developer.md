Hey BSDNow team!

I am a web developer (mostly I use Ruby and sometimes Golang) and I have a huge will to start doing system programming. I tried to dig into FreeBSD codebase and try to understand the OS concept, but it was too much new information, so I gave up. What is the best way to dive into FreeBSD and BSD world in general and then start being a *BSD developer?

I’ve got FreeBSD on my laptop, but I found that I want a bit deeper experience (but I don’t have such tasks at work or in my free time). I’d be glad to hear your experience and the way you learn BSDs and contribute to the BSD world.

I really appreciate the podcasts you do. You are great!

Thank you!
