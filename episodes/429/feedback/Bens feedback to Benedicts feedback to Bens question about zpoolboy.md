Hi Benedict,

Thanks for the reply!

Yes, I'm very much looking forward to it — these sorts of fiction with substantial actual tech content scratch a certain type of itch for me (obviously I enjoy Michael's fiction a lot).

It's hard to say whether the marked-up version or the other would be better - I can imagine pros and cons to each. 

I'll keep an eye out for it and definitely will let you know my reactions. Maybe it could turn into series?

cheers,
  —Ben
