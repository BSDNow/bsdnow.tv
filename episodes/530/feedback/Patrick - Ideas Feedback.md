Hey guys. I enjoy the show, and I know you've been looking for more feedback. So I wanted to throw a couple of ideas out there.

1. I know there are some software projects out there that would be interested in porting their software to FreeBSD, but perhaps they don't have team members skilled in programming for FreeBSD. Is there some kind of central hub for software projects to advertise their desire to port to FreeBSD and for programmers familiar with FreeBSD to find projects to contribute to?

2. In the same vein, maybe BSD Now could make it a regular part of the show to highlight a software project each week that is working on porting their project to FreeBSD and is looking for developers. If you decide to do this, I'd like to suggest DOSemu2: https://github.com/dosemu2/dosemu2/issues/506

[JT's comment - People should email in software projects that they know of that are porting or have put out a call for devs]

3. FreeBSD's Linux compatibility is continuing to grow by leaps and bounds. Is there currently any effort, or is it even feasible, for FreeBSD to have something comparable to Waydroid which allows Android to run natively without the overhead of emulation?
