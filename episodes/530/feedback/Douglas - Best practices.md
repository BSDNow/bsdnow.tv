Douglas, 
Hello guys. I’ve been silently listening to your show for a while and I enjoy it as a source of learning on my path toward running FreeBSD as a daily driver.

I have of course gone thru the handbook (which is great), and I have gone thru excellent website by vermaden in order to get basic GUI desktop in place.

I’m hoping that you have places to turn for regular user examples of a few subjects. What I am hoping to find are what are considered ‘best practices’ for security and hardening with tutorial and explanation.

I want real-world, everyday use of YubiKey, encrypted drive backup and restore (your tarsnap service), exposed ports, user permissions and ACLs, pretty much anything else that would be “this is what you should do if you care about this stuff” kinds of things. Hopefully this all makes sense.

I use LibreWolf for things that are sensitive online, KeyPassXC for password manager to a file, have enabled GELI encryption for the system. Ideally if I could have anything, I would have a home NetCloud style server setup that would sync over something like WireGuard to a GrapheneOS phone (which I am now using) and then that home server was being backed up to something like tarsnap OR to incremental LTO tapes that I would take offsite.

I just want to find others that care about these things and are willing to share in a more concise place versus the shotgun approach of multiple tabs of garbage on various websites to figure out the most up to date and ‘everyday user’ aspects of these things.

I am somewhat technical but am nowhere near the level of knowledge needed for all of this, especially not on FreeBSD

Where do you recommend I turn?
