Hello BSDNow people!

I am a blogger, as well as port maintainer for a few ports on OpenBSD

I just wrote up a blog post about common misconceptions about the *BSDs
on my tumblr:

It would be neat if you guys could cover it on the show!

Might be worth linking my personal neocity as well as that serves as
a hub all of my various weblinks where people can find my content:

Y'all have a great show.

Keep it up!
