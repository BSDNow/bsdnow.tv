Hello guys! Thanks for a great podcast. I am not particularly a bsd guy but I am and have been getting into zfs on Linux spacificly Ubuntu. I also follow Allen Jude and Jim Salter and have followed all their zfs advice but I have come to a little snag. I know there are some settings/options that must be set at zpool creation for the life of me I cannot find a guide or video that lists them. I would love to get a list of those options so I can officially get my zpool correct for my servers. I'm not running anything critical I'm running Plex and Nextcloud currently. I want to set up a VM test farm for future projects also and I know VM storage needs different settings. Anyways thanks in advance for your help!
