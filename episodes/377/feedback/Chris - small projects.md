Hi JT, Allan and Benedict,
Thanks for all your work on the show.  I found it at the start of lock down, and it has been keeping me sane, stimulating my curiousity and inspired to to dive into FreeBSD for the first time.  I am Loving what I am finding, wish I had discovered it all sooner.  

I am really an end user, with curiousity but no computer science experience or formal learning.  I am coming from about 20 years of perpetually falling out with Windows, but not having the knowledge and skills to resolve the typical road bumps you get in linux.  The documentation in FreeBSD has been the best I have ever come across, things are clear I make progress and I am hooked.  I have written the odd bash script using rsync and nfs and toyed with a little c++.

Could you recommend 3-5 small to medium sized projects that will strike the balance between providing a challenge, while not getting a newbie stuck in the weeds, but also covering a small range of basic FreeBSD sysadmin skills you feel a newbie needs to a have a functionally meaningful (if basic) working FreeBSD skill set? 

Thanks again for the Pod cast - look forward to the next one.  
Best regards
Chris
