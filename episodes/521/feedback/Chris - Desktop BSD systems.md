Hi Benedict, Allan, JT, and Tom,

I love your show! I never miss a single episode and find the content entertaining and very educational. Now onto my question...

I run TrueNAS at home to back up Mac and Windows files to and so my wife and I can share household related files over the network. I also have an old PC I run GhostBSD on as a backup for my TrueNAS system. I run an rsync job twice a day to pull data from TrueNAS to the GhostBSD system and is the primary use of the GhostBSD system.

I opted for GhostBSD instead of FreeBSD because I wanted a desktop, but didn't want to deal with configuring it. The desktop is useful in that while I use a Macbook Pro as my daily driver, I also occasionally hop onto my GhostBSD desktop when I am sanity checking network issues that crop up from time to time. 

The default desktop for GhostBSD is Mate but I am a huge fan of Fluxbox and use it at work. It's great for speed and lets me keep 30+ workspaces with dozens of terminals open on each one that I can quickly switch between. My only issue with Fluxbox is I have had difficulty in the past getting some GUI apps to run and display correctly.

Do any of you run a desktop environment on any of your BSD systems? If so, which one? Would you recommend GhostBSD or do you prefer installing FreeBSD and configuring the desktop on your own? 

Thanks and keep up the great work!

Chris
