I'm currently working on modernizing a software project in C from the 80s and I'd like to setup my own build machines for some of the BSDs to test compatibility.  I'm not opposed to paying for VM access or applying to the GCC compile farm for access, but I have a small build farm at home (i686/x86_64, aarch64/armv7/rpi1, riscv64, 32-bit ppc) so it's probably more convenient to use my local machines for now.  Is there a recommended way to setup either build infrastructure for some of the BSDs on non-BSD systems or creating a BSD environment (or chroot or something) where I can do the builds by hand? I could also order some spare SSDs and SDcards and reboot the machines regularly but I know I won't be very likely to use them often if I go that route.
