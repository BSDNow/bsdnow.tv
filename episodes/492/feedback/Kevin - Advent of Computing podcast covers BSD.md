Hi BSD Now crew,

A year or two ago, Allan mentioned The advent of computing podcast, and Iâ€™ve been a happy listener of both shows ever since.

This week, Sunday January 8th, host Sean Haas covered the origins of Berkeley Software Distribution in Episode 99. Check it out at https://adventofcomputing.com

Thanks for the great show.

Kevin
