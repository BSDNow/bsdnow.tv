Dear Alan, Benedict & JT

I became a FreeBSD and OpenBSD addicted after I broke my long-last relationship with Debian during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now I run FreeBSD on my main laptop and "cloud" servers, OpenBSD over and old Acer NetBook (do your remember the NetBook era?).

After discovering FreeBSD I also started listening BSDNow TV but so far I just reached ep. 372... Starting I think from ep. 200 (not sure though...) 

I love the free software culture but in the end looks like the BSD licenses are doing a better job to make all the parties involved happy.

I am just passionate about informatics which leads me to have a small FreeBSD VPS for running a small capsule where mostly I like to share my journey on Gemini and FreeBSD/OpenBSD. 

Actually I had to shutdown my previous capsule on Digital Ocean since they dismissed official support for FreeBSD droplet and therefore I dismissed them, now I am building a new FreeBSD based Capsule on Vultr...

This time I decided to share the VPS to another dude involved in the Gemini project, and I'd like to put in action some restrictions; for instance: I'd like to whitelist certain file extensions (.jpg, .png. .txt, .gmi, etc..) or blacklist file depends on it works; I'd like to put a limitation for the maximum weight allowed for uploading any file; quotas for each user (this is the only topic I found on the handbook).

I read the handbook several time but I couldn't find anything related, also looks like sftp can't handle such requirements. I did not have idea if what I want to do if even feasible so any suggestions or recommendations is welcomed!

Keep up with your great show,
Freezr
