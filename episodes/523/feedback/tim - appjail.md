Hi All, 

Just curious whether any of you have had a chance to check out AppJail, which seems to be a fairly feature complete jail management framework, written in C and Bourne shell, focused on creating jails that behave like applications.  Its web site is <https://github.com/DtxdF/AppJail>.  I first saw it mentioned in one of Vermaden's "Valuable News" posts.

I looked online to see whether it's well regarded, but don't see it mentioned in the FreeBSD handbook, or the FreeBSD wiki site (https://wiki.freebsd.org/Jails#Jail_Management_Tools).

Thanks,
Tim
