How do I enable automatic switching of audio between my speakers and my headphones? When I plug my headphones in, audio should go to them. When I unplug them, audio should revert to the speakers. Such a seemingly simple thing has been a real headache trying to solve. I've found very few Google results on the topic, and the best I've been able to achieve has been getting the audio from the speskers to shut off when I plug in my headphones, but there is no audio from my headphones. And manually changing the active audio output is tedious. Thank you so much if you can help me solve this.
