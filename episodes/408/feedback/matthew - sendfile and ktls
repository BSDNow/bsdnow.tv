Hi all,

The discussion around sendfile and ktls in episode 400 surprised me a little. The problem of using sendfile with connection encryption is familiar to me. But I was expecting the solution to involve BPF. Is there a reason specifically TLS support was implemented and not a more general “apply this arbitrary transformation function to incoming data” API? Maybe ktls is even implemented internally this way?

Thanks,
Matt
