Hi Allan, Benedict, JT and Tom,

Tom, this is probably a networking question for you. Thank you very much regardless if you decide to answer it in the show.

In the last episode you and Benedict spoke about IPFS and you mentioned that OpenBSD developer has issues with her DSL with too many connections. This is completely off-topic since I would like to ask about the network - about handling too many connections.

I too have problems with my DSL with some applications that create a lot of connections. Is this something that can be solved by VPN? Maybe Wireguard VPN from my OpenWrt router to VPS in digitalocean? The VPS definitely won’t have problem with many connections but I’m not sure if encapsulating it into a single VPN tunnel makes things better or worse...

Thank you.

Dan
