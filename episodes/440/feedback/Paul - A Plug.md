Hi Benedict, Allan, Tom and JT

I have a quick plug for you.

I've recorded a talk on "Upstreaming the FreeBSD Port" which will be in the Valgrind dev room (not the BSD one) : https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/valgrind_freebsd/

It will be on Sunday 6th of February at 14:20 Brussels time. It's scheduled to last 55 minutes.


Cheers

Paul
