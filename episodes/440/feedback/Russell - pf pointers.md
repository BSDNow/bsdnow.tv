Howdy guys (not sure who will be on this episode)

So, y'all want questions and I have some help I'd love to receive. :D

I BSD all the things :P trying to keep that yucky Linux out of my life.  However, I still use Ubiquiti for my network gear (and my parents and other family members) and run an instance of the controller on a Digital Ocean droplet.

My ideal setup, I think, is to put it in a jail on a droplet, then have a Wireguard server in another jail, and make it so to administer I have to connect to wireguard then can access that web interface.  Could y'all give me some pointers—using pf—to put me on the right track?  Currently the forums seem to be down and trying to piece together bits and pieces and put it all together is a bit of a chore.

Thanks!
