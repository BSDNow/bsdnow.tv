Hi Allan, Benedict, JT and Tom,
Greetings and salutations from Windsor Ontario.
Thanks to your show and MWL Absolute FreeBSD I entered the *BSD world 2.5 years ago.
I started with a RaspberryPi and I managed to try many FreeBSD features on it. Gopher, Apache, zfs mirror using two usb thumb-drives, DLNA server to name a few.

Finally last summer I built a new computer with a Ryzen 3200G, 16G of memory, an ssd zroot for the system and two ironwolves 4T each as a mirror zpool. I use the ironwolves pool as storage for various files as a NAS. As a newbie I am trying to avoid surprises and I run FreeBSD 12.2-R and I haven't 'zpool upgrade' my pools yet.

I am very excited for the FreeBSD 13.0-R as I will get my graphics supported.
One of the following weekends I will take the time to do the new installation. It is going to be a nice opportunity for me to set up the system from scratch and clean it up.

I would like to ask you what would be the proper/safer way to upgrade my computer. I don't care about the zroot pool but I do care about the ironwolves mirror pool.
Shall I 'zpool  export' the ironwolves before the new install and 'zpool import' after the finish of the installation?
Is there anything specific to be careful during the process?

Thank you for being there for the *BSD community.
I hope to see you soon at the next BSDCan.

Best,
