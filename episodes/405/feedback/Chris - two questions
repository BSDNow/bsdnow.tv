Hello - since Benedict always seems so sad about the lack of questions, I felt compelled to get in touch and cheer him up 

I have 2 questions, actually:
1) At some point Benedict mentioned that he manages BSD servers within a university department, and it sounded like this might be related to scientific computing and HPC. Could you talk a bit more about that - in particular what role BSD serves in such a setting? I am not aware of any scientific packages which are routinely run on BSD rather than Linux.

2) Can you guys recommend good "starter projects" for someone already comfortable with Linux but who has never tried BSD - ideally something which would highlight the strengths it has over Linux? The main thing I can think of so far is ZFS - I plan to use FreeBSD the next time I rebuild my home storage server, but it would be nice to have some other use-cases too. Jails seem like the obvious choice as I already try to use Multipass on Ubuntu or Podman containers on RHEL-based distros whenever I can - just wondering what other functionality BSD has which might not be so obvious, but which you think is an improvement over Linux worth trying out.

Thanks!
