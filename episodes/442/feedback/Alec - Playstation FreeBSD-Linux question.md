I have a potentially dumb question.  The Playstation runs on BSD Right?  But wasnt there a Linux version for the Playstation?

Producer Note: 

Yes there was, and obviously I have a copy of it.  You can find more info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_for_PlayStation_2
Linux was also able to be installed on the PS3 and PS4 prior to a certain firmware version. 
PS3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtherOS
PS4 https://medium.com/linuxforeveryone/guide-pc-gaming-on-your-ps4-with-the-power-of-linux-3b0391fb2b2f

Iâ€™m unsure if any community people out there made installable FreeBSD images to use the PS3 and PS4 as a FreeBSD Desktop. The other guys can fill that info in if they know it.
