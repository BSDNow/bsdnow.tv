All,
In the [REDACTED] issue of [REDACTED]
there is an interesting interview by
[REDACTED] with the developers of Berkeley
DB that could make an interesting news item
for you. The impact of that DB has been enormous.
There is a nice quote about their talks with
Google and Amazon: things that happen once in a million times happen millions
of times every day for us

Producers Note:
Weâ€™re going to cover this in a future episode, but I wanted to go ahead and include this to stir up some interest.
