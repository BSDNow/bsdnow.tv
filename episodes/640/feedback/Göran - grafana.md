Hi,
first of all thank you for this podcast.

On the topic of monitoring, you mentioned grafana, but i think most people know „the old ways“ of grafana with separate components for metrics and logs. There is a new tool combining the two called alloy. It can monitor log files, collect metrics and even receive and forward logs from other hosts. You still need loki and prometheus as databases but the collection is quite nice with alloy. It just has the downside that the alloy binary is 300mb :D

But i have tested it and it worked flawlessly on linux and freebsd.

Thanks again for all your trouble every week.

Kind regards
Göran
