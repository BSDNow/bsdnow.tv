Hi
In first place thank you for making a great podcast.

I have a small question about zfs.
I'm using fbsd 13 with zfs and I know that I am able to use native encryption in zpool/zfs dataset.
But I don't know how or if it's possible to make root on zfs with native encryption.
I've tried with a separate boot partition with gptzfsboot but it seems that the encrypted pool is not recognised there.
I know that there is an option with geli+zfs but I want to have only native encryption on zfs :)

with best regards
