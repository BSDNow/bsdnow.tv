Howdy! I am new to the show and to BSD so I apologize if my questions are lame but here I go anyway... When building a Ghost BSD VM in Virt manager the keyboard and mouse inputs do not work. Is there a good way around this? I have seen that on hardware you are supposed to enable legacy support but there is only the one input in Virt Manager.  By way of a more general question, I have seen it said that the *BSD operating systems are more made for developers. I am enjoying messing around with OpenBSD but would I need any actual developer skills if I wanted to use it for webserver or something? Thanks again and I hope you get all those questions you were asking for!
