Hi guys,

Towards the end of the current show (episode 640), one of you issued the immortal line of "storage is cheap". I nearly choked on my sandwich when I heard this emanate from my laptop and would like to know where this "cheap storage" can be obtained from. Here in NZ I have seen SSD and NVMe prices basically double in the last 12 to 18 months, no doubt thanks to our AI friends requiring an endless supply of NAND chips to devour. With Crucial, and potentially other players in the storage market, leaving the consumer drive space we can only expect more grief to come.

So, in summary
  1. Storage IS NOT cheap
  2. Death to AI - maybe it be quick and painful!

Seriously though, thanks for a good show and its nice to see Ruben join the team as I enjoy his blog.

Cheers
Gary
