Hello

Thanks for the show! I have been listening for a couple of years now and the show just keeps getting better and better.

Mu question is: Are there any other podcasts that you listen to or know about that cover similar topics as BSD Now, such as BSD or other operating system podcasts, or perhaps some programming podcasts?

Thanks!
