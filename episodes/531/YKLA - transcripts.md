I come from the FreeBSD Chinese community. Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the tremendous efforts you have put into promoting FreeBSD. However, it's regrettable that different languages come with different worldviews, and the significant language barrier prevents us from gaining a deeper understanding of FreeBSD. This barrier also prevents us from directly listening to BSD Now. (Part of this is due to the government's restricted internet policies; in order to access BSD Now smoothly, we need to invest a certain amount of effort and resources into obtaining a special VPN.) 

I would like to inquire whether there are any written transcripts available for BSD Now that people can read. This would allow us to translate and create a Chinese version of BSD Now based on these transcripts. Thank you very much for your assistance.


Producers Note:

This is on the agenda of things to do, and hopefully by the beginning of the next year I can start releasing these.  There are a few things that need to fall into place first before I can start doing this.
