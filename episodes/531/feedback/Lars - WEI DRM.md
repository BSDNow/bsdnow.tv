Hi,

Google appears to be working to smoothly exploit its position in the
browser market to become gatekeeper for the WWW by rolling out WEI¹, a
new form  of DRM².  There appears to be little to no push back at level
which can influence Google.  Yet.

I'm going to go out on a limb here: Since so much of the desktop is
nowadays centered around the WWW, what are the implications of a
WEI-afflicted WwW for the ongoing future of desktop BSD?

Best,
Lars
