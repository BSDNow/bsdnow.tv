Hi Allan & Benedict, BSDnow is still my favorite podcast.  I had a quick question about ZFS snapshots.

I was wondering when this change happened to list ZFS snapshots?   I was able to create the snapshots fine before an upgrade and when I tried to list all of them so I could destry them at the end of the upgrade (FreeBSD 11.4-p9).   I had difficulty, since it now wanted additional zfs-features flags, I think.

old command:
zfs list -t snapshot

new command:
zfs list -rt all


Followup question:
Is there a different command that now lists "no datasets available" after you remove all the snapshots?
------
Use the zfs list -t snapshot OR zfs list -rf all to verify ALL snapshots are destroyed!  The command will return "no datasets available" if all the snapshots were properly destroyed.

Thanks!
