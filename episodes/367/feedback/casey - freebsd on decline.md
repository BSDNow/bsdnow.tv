All,
Thank you as always for the awesome show! I really do appreciate hearing about all the BSD news. 

I am starting to worry that FreeBSD may be on the decline. Below is a list of reasons why.

    The announcement from iXsystems that they will be developing a version of TrueNAS on linux. (possibly a first step to discontinuing the FreeBSD version)
    The announcement of TrueOS being discontinued.
    The change of project trident from FreeBSD to linux.
    ZFS on linux becoming the upstream for ZFS in general.

Can you guys tell me I am wrong to worry?

I do everything I can to support FreeBSD and other BSDs in general. 
I donate money to the FreeBSD foundation.
I evangelize the BSDs every chance I get.

I really prefer the FreeBSD and OpenBSD ways of doing things compared to the linux way of doing things.

Thanks
Casey
