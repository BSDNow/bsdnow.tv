Hi Allan and Benedict,

Thank you for running the show!

I have a question and a bit of feedback.

Being a long-time Linux user I recently gained interest in FreeBSD. Mostly because I like how thoroughly it is documented. That and the fact the only time when I needed to restart my pfSense-based router was when it was due for update. Which leads me to believe that FreeBSD is a very stable system.

I decided to give it a try and run a small side-project of mine on FreeBSD. What I am not sure about is how Postgres will like to be in a jail. I think I heard somewhere that jails were not super-friendly for databases. Could you provide your perspective on that? The reason I think about jails is reproducibility and isolation. And yes, I'm going to use ZFS and am wondering if I could use ZFS snapshots as a way to backup the database.

That's all for the question. 

As for the feedback, more than once I heard you mentioning GCC in a negative context. While I do understand why it is being/has been removed from the base system, I'm not sure I understand why you are referring to it as if it is something filthy. 

Back when I started my career in early 2000, GCC was superior to any available commercial offering. Being able to use it was like a breath of fresh air. It was the most modern and sophisticated C compiler with a bunch of really cool features. I'd say even more, if not for GCC we wouldn't have had open source now, BSDs included. 

So yeah, while clang seems to be a better architected/engineered product and it gained feature parity with GCC (and has a permissive license), I believe it stands where it is only because it is standing on the shoulders of the G(CC)iant.

Please try to be more respectful towards it.
