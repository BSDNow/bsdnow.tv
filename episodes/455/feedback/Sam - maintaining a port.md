Dear BSDNow,

I'd like to start contributing to the FreeBSD project by volunteering to maintain a port. I have several reasons, but chief among them is wanting to help improve FreeBSD's security posture. Not having the skill to audit kernel code, I figure that if I can adopt a port, I can free up time for someone else who can audit kernel code, and speed up the time-to-patch for third-party software. I've been trying to find a list of unmaintained ports ordered by security priority, so I can volunteer to take on the highest priority port whose code I can understand. I don't know what "security priority" should mean, precisely; maybe a combination of the port's popularity, length of its code, and the number of bugs it's had historically? Is there such a list, and if so, can you direct me to it? If not, what would you recommend? Also, are there any security-oriented projects for FreeBSD that elicit volunteers? The TrustedBSD and Kernel Stress Test Suite projects's web pages don't seem to have a list of tasks they'd like help with, and those are the only security-specific projects I can find.

Thanks so much for producing this podcast. It continues to teach me a lot and is the highlight of my Thursdays.

--Sam.
