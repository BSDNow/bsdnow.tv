Hi Benedict, Allan, Tom, and JT,

What steps do you take to secure a FreeBSD box with services exposed to the internet? For example, on Debian, I get the low-hanging fruit like sshd_config, firewall rules, and monitoring, and I always add some platform-specific tools like unattended-upgrades and AppArmor. These basic things give me peace of mind and confidence when using that platform. I'd love to hear your tips for deploying FreeBSD in production without losing sleep!

I've discovered the show recently and truly enjoy listening. Thanks so much for sharing your extensive knowledge and experience!

Ben
