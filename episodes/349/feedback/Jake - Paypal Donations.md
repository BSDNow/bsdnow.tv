Hey guys.  Thanks for as always for the show.  I've noticed that when I pay for something with PayPal they ask if I want to donate a dollar to the FreeBSD Foundation.  I do.  Does that get counted as an individual donation or does it look like one big donation?  I'm thinking about the 501C3 public good situation.  Thanks again. --jake
