Hi All,


I attended a BSD talk at SCale 20x which I think merits coverage by your podcast.  It's called "Cloud Native FreeBSD", presented by Karen Bruner.  It covers efforts to make FreeBSD a first-class K8s citizen, e.g., getting containerd and podman ported, creating OCI compliant images, etc.  Here's a link to its page on the SCaLE web site:  <https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x/presentations/cloud-native-freebsd>. 

I believe individual videos for each presentation will be made available, but in the meanwhile you should be able to locate it on YT, etc., by searching for the video feed from Ballroom G on Saturday, March 11, 2023, then skipping to the portion recorded from 16:30 to 17:30.


Regards,
Tim
