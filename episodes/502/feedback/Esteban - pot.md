I wanted to point out an interesting project on the FreeBSD space. It is called FreeBSD Pot. 
Out of the GitHub repo: 

“ Another container framework based on jails, to run FreeBSD containers on FreeBSD. Every running instance is called pot, like the one that I use to cook all the different type of pasta. It's heavily based on FreeBSD, in particular on jails, ZFS, pf and rctl.

The project's initial goal was to prove that FreeBSD has all the technologies to have a container-alike environment. The project then evolved into something more robust and feature-rich.”

The project documentation can be found at https://pot.pizzamig.dev/ 

There is also a docker hub like page for already made recipes under: https://potluck.honeyguide.net/

I thought it may be something interesting for the listeners of this podcast.

Thanks for all the content!
