Benedict, Allan, Tom and JT,

Just want to comment on how much I appreciate this nugget filled episode. Your podcast is already one of, if not thee podcast with the most technical educational related content, but this episode really helped me learn so much.

I'm teaching myself computer programming and listening to technical podcasts is one of the ways I accelerate that learning. Although some if not most technical podcasts do more table talk than actual teaching, I can always rely on your podcast offering something new to learn or be exposed to.

@Tom, listening to you mention on one of "BSD Nows" earlier episodes, how you were thinking of building a Ryzen 9 system for a build server, it inspired me to bite the bullet and build my own. Although right now I'm too early in my programming journey to make use of a build machine, right now it's being used as a virtual host for all the VMS running services for my family and I.

Thank you all for what you do!

Chunky Pie
