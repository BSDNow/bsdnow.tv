  
Howdy fellas, I was excited to hear you mention making routers out of bsd boxes in the last episode because I am working on one of those now. It's nothing special as this is my first crack at it, just a 4th gen I5 . Now that it is up and running I am going to dive into pf but my question is what do people new to this process usually miss? What should I watch out for? Thanks for all that you do!
-Mike
