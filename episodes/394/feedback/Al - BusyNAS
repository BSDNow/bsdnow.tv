Dear Allan, Benedict

I've eagerly listened to bsdnow starting from episode 1.  Ever since I learned of the data healing property of ZFS, from your show, I've wanted to deploy it in a NAS.
Recently I successfully repurposed a desktop system into a FreeBSD based NAS.  Installation was easy, following the handbook, and it works fine and has a UFS root with geli encrypted mirror.
One evening, while working on my main desktop system, the idling NAS became busy.  A brief view of output from the top utility listed the 'find' command as the main source of activity and also 'zip' among others.
Does ZFS normally engage 'find' and 'zip' from time to time?
As a precaution, when the NAS was suddenly chattering away, I shut it down as well as a nearby Windows desktop.
What should I examine next?
I plan to upgrade the NAS SSH session authentication from password to public key.

Sincerely,
Al
