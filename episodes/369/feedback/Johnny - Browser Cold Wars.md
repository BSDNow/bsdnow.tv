 I really wished I had something more constructive to write into the show with but anyway here it is.  I have tried all these browsers and was using Otter browser regularly since it's intended to be a clone of Opera.  I used to love Opera but they have sold out to google.  All three of these browsers are not to the level of Firefox they all seem to be missing features or they don't work with some of the websites I visit regularly.  I don't think they were ever meant to be a clone of Firefox however when you get used to something you expect it.  As I see it the main issue with browsers other than the 2 main browsers (Mozilla or Chrome) is web developers apparently don't like their users and don't build their websites to be browser agnostic.  I can't imagine that it requires a lot of effort to make a web site browser agnostic in 2020.  Even Firefox is having issues with some sites now so it makes it almost impossible for new innovations to come along outside of Google.  Here we are again back in the middle of another browser war and it seems like it's a cold war this time around.  Anyway love the show and keep up the good work guys.
