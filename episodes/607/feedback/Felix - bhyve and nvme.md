Hey BSDNow team,

I have heard a lot of good things about the bhyve nvme storage driver, which far outperforms alternatives like VirtIO, especially on Windows guests for some reason.

I tried it myself a while ago and it really was incredibly fast, but now the question is, why?

There are a lot of speculations as to why bhyve's NVMe emulation is so much faster, but none of them I found had any concrete evidence.

Do you have any idea why, or do you know someone who can shed some light on this?

Thanks and keep up the good work.

Felix
