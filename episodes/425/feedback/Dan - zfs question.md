Hello,

This is a simple question with what I think probably has a simple answer?

There are many guides on the Internet that show you how to use ZFS's snapshot, send, and receive to backup, copy, or move datasets and volumes.

The one area that always throws me off is the "-r" and "-R" flags.  Some instructions use "-r" when taking a snapshot and others do not.  Same issue with "-R" during ZFS send.  There is no explanation on the differences between using and not using those flags.  What exactly do they do and when does it makes sense to use or not use them?
