Hi Guys,
Love the show.  I have a question for the author of Advance!BSD non-profit I wonder if this person knows about https://sdf.org it's a non-profit that does many of the things this individual is looking for and sdf has been around for a really long time now and I know they are always open for various new projects and they already offer VPS services among many others.  I have an account with sdf.org but other than that I have no other affiliation with them.   
I don't like the Linux Chimera idea.  It would be very hard for the end user to get support upstream since it is not truly a Linux distro or FreeBSD.  It's similar to Debian using the FreeBSD kernel which I don't think has a very big user base.  I just don't see it going anywhere without full support for both systems.  Anyway loved the show and can't wait for the next one.
