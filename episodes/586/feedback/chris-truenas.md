Greetings Benedict, Tom, JT, and Jason,

I hope this email finds you well. I love your podcast and never miss an episode. 

I have a few questions about TrueNAS and the decision by iX Systems to jettison FreeBSD and to switch solely to Linux. 

    Do you have any insight as to why they made such as decision? Was it just to lighten the support and maintenance load?
    Does TrueNAS on Linux perform as well as it did on FreeBSD? (I thought at least early on, Linux only supported ZFS at the user-level, not the kernel-level, causing performance to suffer greatly)
    Would you recommend I upgrade my TrueNAS instance to the latest Linux version?
    If not, at what point would you recommend I jettison my TrueNAS install and cut over to the latest version of FreeBSD with ZFS and "roll my own" NAS solution? In the event I go this route, any tried and true resources you could point me to would be appreciated!

Thanks guys!

Chris
