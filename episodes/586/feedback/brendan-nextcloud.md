Hi BSD Now crew,

What are your views on using NFS or S3 (e.g. minio) as a storage back end for applications like Nextcloud on a FreeBSD host? I want to separate the app from the data and I am looking at how to pass storage to a VM.
I plan on running the nextcloud app in a VM that lives on my SSD pool and keeping the data on spinning rust. 

Regards,
Brendan.
