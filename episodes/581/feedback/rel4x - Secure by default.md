"Episode 565 - Secure by default" inspired me to send an email, to say thank you for the show.


I suppose I'm one of those systemd escapees. I had been using a "GNU/Linux" system for many years and around a year ago decided to change to a systemd-free distribution.
Have you seen the man page for 'systemd.unit' and the table 'Load path when running in user mode'? [1]
I think the first gray-colored hair appeared on my face after having to do troubleshooting/forensics on a systemd-based "GNU/Linux" distro.

I tried several kinds of systemd-free "GNU/Linux" distributions (yes, also Alpine and no GNU Core Utilities there) but ended up having an uneasy feeling about them.
Why are there gazillion different "Linux" distributions out there anyway? I kept wondering that even with the systemd-free distros, how much more polished would they be if there were maybe maximum of five instead of over twenty?

I think it was three to four months ago that I had finally had enough. After few weekends with lots of coffee and prescription amphetamines I had successfully installed and configured FreeBSD on the desktop PC and OpenBSD on the laptop.
The FreeBSD installer and the IPFW firewall with the default firewall type `workstation` made the initial change actually really easy. If I would have had to learn PF immediately just to get some sort of protection against the internet transmitted diseases of the World Wide Web, it would have made the change way more intimidating.
(Yes, I got the Hansteen book after a while, studied the PF FAQ and the laptop now has PF enabled, no worries :D)

Still in the early days of using these systems but already liking them a lot. Both feel more coherent and less chaotic/fragmented compared to many of the "Linux" distros I had to endure for not knowing better.

The podcast has been a great motivator and a source of inspiration along the way. I don't think I would have heard of almost any of the write-ups without the podcast functioning as an aggregator for BSD content. So yeah, without making this any longer, thank you (the hosts and the various authors ofc) for the podcast! =)
