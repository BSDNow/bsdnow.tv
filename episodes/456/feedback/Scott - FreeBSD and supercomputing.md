FreeBSD and supercomputing?

After traveling down a Wikipedia rabbithole that lead to supercomputers, I came across the statement that since 2017, all the top 500 supercomputers have run Linux. This struck me as odd (and as a FreeBSD-fan, depressing) since one always hears how FreeBSD is designed and is perfect for back-end servers. Linux might win the desktop over BSD for understandable reasons, but why does it win HPC (high-performance computing)? With BSD's networking advantage, it'd seem this networking performance would come into play perfectly when needing to interconnect a lot of nodes. And a company using FreeBSD would be free to leverage their HPC solution for more commercial uses than with Linux due to the licensing difference.

I've read some explanations but most of them strike me as the same reasoning that Windows had a near monopoly on desktop PCs... stuff like "inertia" and "momentum", and everyone using Linux [in HPC] simply because everyone is using it.  Some of it is just misinformed/incorrect ("BSD doesn't support Infiniband" etc). One would hope that the same people who criticized the Windows monoculture on the desktop would also see the negatives of having a worse monoculture in the HPC world.

So I ask you guys: why do YOU think Linux has completely decimated BSD in HPC? What could be done to address this (or is there already stuff being done to address the issue)? Do you know of any supercomputers running BSD?
