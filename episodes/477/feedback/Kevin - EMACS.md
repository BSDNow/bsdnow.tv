Hi Allan, Benedict, Tom and JT,

Thank you for such a great show! I look forward to BSD content and community each week.

I am comfortable with vi and ee on FreeBSD. I also like Emacs and mg. Over ssh, they work just fine. But on the local console or in an X session, the backspace key does not delete a character, but sends the control-H prefix instead.

How do I fix this?

Thanks,
Kevin
