Hi Fellows,
  This has got to be the coolest episode ever.  I really enjoyed it since I will probably never be able to attend a conference so it's very much appreciated.  Anyway did you fellows know that DragonflyBSD has code bounties for new features.  I stumbled across them so maybe that could be a topic for the show.  They need stuff like the HID daemon and UTF-8 in the console and many other things that we in FreeBSD just take for granted.  I guess its not major news but I was just surprised since some of these has been on the list for a few years.  Yep Episode 512kb will be very memorable and welcome JT2.  I can't wait for episode 1024kb.
