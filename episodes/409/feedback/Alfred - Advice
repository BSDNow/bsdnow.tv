Dear Alan, Bendict,

Why do I have to "zpool import -a" my zfs pool each time I boot my system?
When my, geli encrypted, disk mirror was installed on RELEASE-12.2 they did not need "zpool import".
After an upgrade to RELEASE-13 and "zpool upgrade", the mirror needs to be imported after each restart.
By the way, the base system is installed on a UFS disk.

I look forward to your advise.
