Hello! I got a new laptop and was wondering if there was a way to mount the old laptop's drive over the network to migrate all my old data, like section 8.2 from the faq https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/faq/#disks. As far as I can tell, the indicated faq question would work on a desktop machine with more than one drive attached. Thanks in advance!
