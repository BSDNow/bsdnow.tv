Greetings.

My name is Andreas. I've had a question about FreeBSD/ZFS and TRIM combinations.
Have posted it on the FreeBSD Forums earlier; however they pointed me towards you, telling;

"Allan Jude hosts the BSD Now podcast, and is active in ZFS development. They take questions, and may give answers."

So my question is located at here if you could kindly read in a free time of you and provide me an answer, I'd be most grateful!

Thank you so much,
Best.
