Hello BSD Now Team,

Swift, an open source language developed by Apple, is supported on
Apple platforms, Linux, and Windows. But it's not supported on any of
the BSDs. There appeared to be some interest in porting it a few years
ago but that has withered away.

I wonder why there is sporadic interest but no sustained effort. Is it
because Swift Server Working Group is still nascent and Swift on
Server doesn't have wider community adoption yet? Does the BSD
community expect the language community to step up and do more (like
the Python, Go, etc. communities)? Is there just no intersection of
developer groups interested in BSDs and Swift?

I was just curious to know what the BSD Now community and the BSD
community think about this situation. Thanks for the sustained high
quality of the show.
