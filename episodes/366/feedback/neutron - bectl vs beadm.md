Hello, JT, Benedict and, Allan. 

I have been downloading, installing, and using beadm for a while now mostly out of habit.
I recently found out that FreeBSD ships with something similar called bectl included in the base install.
My question is; Can an argument be made (other than familiarity) to keep using beadm or should we just scrap it, and start using bectl from now on?

Thanks in advance.
