Hi guys,

still enjoying the show since the recommendation on bsdtalk!

So, (with no need to answer them all on one show) some questions for you:

1) With Lua in the bootloader will Lua end up in base? Lua also used for ZFS Channel Programs, isn't it?

2) How about an option to create a dataset for every users HOME? Having separate snapshots, quotas and delegations would be pretty useful

3) Somewhat related: Do you know a tool for managing snapshots that purges empty ones, i.e. those with no changes/used=0kb? Maybe even keeping some more older ones around instead?

Keep up the good show!

Kind regards,
Florian 

PS: Thanks for the answer how to go from -STABLE to -RELEASE dozens of episodes ago! Worked like a charm : )
