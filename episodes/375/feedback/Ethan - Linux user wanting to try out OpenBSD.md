Hey there,

I'm a Linux user that's been wanting to try out OpenBSD. I've read some
of the FAQ pages and watched a really good presentation on why OpenBSD
is more secure than other operating systems. But I'm not sure I can just
jump in directly from Linux. 

I'd also like to learn about ZFS. I'm actually a sys admin but I've
always worked with Linux servers, mainly CentOS. I've signed up for the
zedfs.com mailing list and I'm hoping I'll learn a bit from that.

Finally, I've did some Linux kernel development as a way to support
things that I use in ways additionaly to monetary. I would also like to
for OpenBSD, but I've never used CVS and it doesn't seem guides for
contributing are as heavily produced like they are for Linux. In general
I would just like to become more involed in the BSD community, I love
the show and I'm currently working my way back through the episodes.
Keep it up!

Sincerely,
	Ethan
