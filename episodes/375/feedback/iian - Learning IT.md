Hello Allan, Benedict & JT,
I am currently learning general IT. I am a hoobyist at the moment but in the future it may become a potential career path. I know some Windows, macOS and Linux but am completely new to BSD and think it is a gap in my knowledge that I should fill, especially in the server space. I have always been told that the best way to learn is by doing, so I was thinking of spinning up a FreeBSD droplet on Digital Ocean and doing "something" with it. Unfortunately I lack imagination and wondered if you guys had any ideas for a simple, productive and informative project for an absolute beginner?
I love the show, keep up the good work.
Yours sincerely,
Iain
