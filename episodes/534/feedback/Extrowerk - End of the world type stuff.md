Hi,

i have just read this article which raising some really interesting questions:
https://www.evalapply.org/posts/cold-restart-total-outage/index.html

I pretty like the part "Cold starts with empty caches causes too much load on databases. And then the failures cascade." it would ne nice to hear your practical experiences regarding this or similar topics.

Considering BSDs are fully operating systems (codebase contains ever key part) they could be useful in a civilisational disaster-recovery, also there are nonBSD operating systems meant for post-apocaliptyc situations, like Collapse OS and Dusk OS ( https://www.osnews.com/story/136401/collapse-os-gets-a-successor-dusk-os )
