Hi Allan and Benedict and JT and Tom,

I heard you needed more feedback, so I thought I would toss a non-ZFS question out there. I have been messing with jails for a couple of years. I started with (and have stuck with) iocage. But I was looking at the Container Orchestration in FreeBSD wiki page, and saw that there were

    bastille
    ezjail
    iocage/ioc/iocell
    pot
    cbsd


So I have two questions. First, (and I know your answer is going to be "it depends." but I have to ask. Which is better and/or what are the differences between the different management tools?

The second question is is there interoperabililty between jail tools? Can I build a jail with iocage and manage it later with bastille? Or can I change tools in midstream or do i have to recreate the jail in the new tool?

Thanks.
