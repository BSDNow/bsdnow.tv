Hello BSDNow team!

Just wanted to drop a note saying I loved the little digression about deprecation and support at the end of episode 569.

I’ve been a programmer for my entire career, and this really resonated with me. It’s one of the reasons that there is so much “rot” in the Microsoft ecosystem in particular, and I think (hot take warning) this applies to many other ecosystems like Java which boast nearly infinite backward compatibility.

This sounds like a great feature to some suits, I’m sure, but let me tell you, it’s a TERRIBLE idea! It just chokes the whole ecosystem slowly as the burden of supporting “legacy" code grows ever larger. It’s a perpetual tax that kills innovation.

In addition to the BSDs, I’d also point to Apple (the iOS ecosystem in particular) asa positive example. They have an N-1 major version support policy (more or less; few exceptions), and most developers follow suit with their projects. The Rust programming language is another example, with releases every 6 weeks, and an ecosystem of crates which follow semantic versioning, continuous testing, and so on.

I think the key thing all three have in common is that they have normalized incremental change. Frequent updates and a long history of not breaking things mean that adoption of the latest versions is always great (if not the majority). This frees developers, security professionals, and so on from focusing on 5+ year old systems, and ensures that the ecosystems are allowed to evolve without being hampered by “legacy” support.

Cheers, and thanks for the great episode!
Ian
