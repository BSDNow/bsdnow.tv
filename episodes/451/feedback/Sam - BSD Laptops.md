In digging through my old notes, I found an email that came in for our AMA, but it's a good question and I think is worth of being answered before the end of the year. :P

Question -- BSD Laptops: Your Strategies and OEMs
===================================================

I made the jump to open-source desktop operating systems in 2008 after my beloved Apple PowerBook G4 bit the dust. Now, nearly 14 years later, I'm fortunate enough to use FreeBSD professionally (and recreationally) as a server OS, and am looking to make the switch from Linux to FreeBSD on the desktop. I know there are desktop-oriented BSDs out there, but as Michael Lucas points out in "Absolute FreeBSD", 'learning an operating system is like learning a language; total immersion is the quickest and most powerful way to learn.' 

End-user oriented distros like Debian and Fedora have dulled my wits; in recent years I've just taken to going to my favorite electronics retailer, finding an inexpensive laptop that I like, and using DuckDuckGo to confirm that at least one person on the web has reported running *some* Linux distro on it. This strategy hasn't worked too well for me for FreeBSD, mostly because there don't seem to be as many people reporting being able to run FreeBSD with a GUI (one of my requirements) on current hardware. I am aware of the "Laptops running FreeBSD" article on the FreeBSD wiki, but most of the hardware there is older, and the newer laptops have WiFi functionality listed as "does not work" or "unknown/untested". (Yeah, I'm picky.)  

I know the issue of hardware compatibility is asked ad nauseum on the FreeBSD forums, but can you share your own strategies for finding laptops on which FreeBSD can run a desktop environment? Have you had any experience with OEMs who'll ship laptops that they *know* FreeBSD can support? I'd love to support a FOSS-friendly OEM, but most either only ship products running Linux, or offer BSDs alongside so many Linux distros as to suggest they're just along for the ride.
