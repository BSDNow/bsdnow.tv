Hello,  

I just started listening to your pod cast... I think it's great!  I want to move my mac pro 2019 to FreeBSD  or if not FreeBSD then any version of BSD. I have found one linux distro that I can boot, but it's not BSD.  Is there a BSD distro that can boot a mac pro 2019?  Or will the BSD distros ever catch up the the one linux distro (I think it was ubuntu) I found.


Thanks,
Alexandra
