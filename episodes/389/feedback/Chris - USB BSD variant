Allan, Benedict, and JT

First off, thanks for a great show. Keep up the good work.

I have a quick question: is there a USB BSD variant that provides a bootable and persistent in-memory hypervisor OS? I've been a fan of SmartOS's paradigm for years and think a FreeBSD option would be ideal. The closest I've found is NomadBSD, but it appears to be live Desktop OS. Perhaps it would be a good place to start.

Thanks
