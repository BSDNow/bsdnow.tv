Hello BSD Now Team

There was the question from Benedict regarding a Nextcloud installation guide. I have followed the one from Samuel Dowling and had with it the perfect entry into the world of FreeBSD jails. There is even a guide to install a reverse proxy, what was perfect to get other services external and internal available.

Thank you all for all your work
Ben
