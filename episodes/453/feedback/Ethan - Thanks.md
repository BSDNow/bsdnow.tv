Hi, 

I heard your call for feedback and decided to write in. I have been listening to the show for a few months now and find it refreshingly different from all the other *nix podcasts I listen to. I just got started in Linux recently and am still learning lots and NetBSD is next on my list of things to try. Thanks for the great podcast and keep up the good work.
