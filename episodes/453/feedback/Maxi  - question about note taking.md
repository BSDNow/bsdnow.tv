Dear BSD Now team,

first I want to thank you very much for your show.
Your podcast accompanies me for almost a year now and it's the only one I'm
listening to on regular basis. I'm considering myself a novice BSD user and a
lot of topics you've discussed helped me to understand the technology better.
I'm feeling a lot more comfortable in BSD land than I ever felt in Linux land.
So please keep up your wonderful work. I'm looking forward to every new episode ^^

Since I love to learn new things I also like to keep track or notes along my
journey. So my question to you is, if you don't mind answering:

What do you use for writing down and saving knowledge?
Do you use paper based solutions or some kind of digital vault of knowledge such
as a personal wiki?

Kind regards and happy Easter holidays

Maxi
