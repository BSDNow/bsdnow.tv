ok ok, you always want more questions , so…

I’m experimenting with poudriere on FreeBSD for the first time.

Is there a way to pass a flag to the C/C++ compiler when building *everything*?  For example, let’s say I want to build everything with -fsanitize=safe-stack -fsanitize=cfi can that be done?

Thanks,

Sean
