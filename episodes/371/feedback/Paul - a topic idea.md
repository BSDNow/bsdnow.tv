I would like to propose a topic.  Jail management software. While it is FreeBSD specific, I guess it is important enough. I was long time user of ezjail which seems to be recommended jail management tool for FreeBSD. But last year switched to "cbsd". I was impressed by it's capabilities. It not only usual create/run/destroy but uniuq feature as jail server cluster and jail-motion between servers. It also can manage bhyve/xen VM-s
