Hi Benedict and Allan,

I am a longtime listener and BSD dabbler (thanks to you) and I'd like to say I very much enjoy your show, I look forward to it every week! In episode 355 Benedict mentioned that Tarnsap works in macOS, Linux and Cygwin. I thought you might like to know that it also works under Windows Subsystem for Linux fine, I use it for my monthly safety backup. All the best!
