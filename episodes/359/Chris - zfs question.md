First off thank you for what you do. I've been with you all since the beginning and have enjoyed the edutainment.

I have a pool of 2 x vdevs with 8 x 8TB drives and I just purchased 8 x 10TB drives to add a new vdev. The current drives are a few years old and I'm wondering if I should swap some of the new drives into the existing vdevs. This would create a mix of old and new drives across all 3 vdevs. Is this worth the trouble? What would this process look like? I realize this could tedious, but might help if there are successive failures due to age/wear-n-tear later on.

Any feedback and recommendations are welcome as I have to meticulously plan this since the servers and storage reside in a colo.

For those that are curious this is a iXsystems 2u server with an external 45 bay SuperMicro disk shelf.
