Hi, JT, Allan, and Benedict,

Happy Midsummer.

Which hardware would have 8- to 12-port gigabit Ethernet and be
capable of running OpenBSD? This would need to be available in Europe.

Bonus for non-x86 systems.  If one can dream, it would be very nice to
have GPIO pins as well, but the essential characteristic would be
gigabit Ethernet for all 8 or 12 ports.
