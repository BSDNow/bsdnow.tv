Hey man, I have a ZFS pool that consists of a single RAIDZ1 VDEV with three 4TB disks in it. I recently put some more RAM in the machine that I use as a NAS which is running CentOS 8. before I knew it I was getting checksum errors on all three drives, I shut off the system and took out the new RAM as soon as I saw them but it was in the three hundreds already. Now my pool won't import with an error message of "corrupted metadata" (https://zfsonlinux.org/msg/ZFS-8000-72/). I've enable ZFS debug messaging and the main issue is checksum errors (error = 55 or EBADE). I've tried importing it with -FX as a last resort but it just says one or more devices is unavailable. I've also tried using a patch from one of the ZoL devs to disable the txg restriction on rewinds and using -T to rewind to an earlier txg but it didn't work as well. Attached to the email is a copy of the ZFS debug log from whenever I try to import the pool. Anything you can do to help will be greatly appreciated as my backups are lacking, thanks in advanced
