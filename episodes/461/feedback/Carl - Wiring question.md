Dear Allan, Benedict, JT and Tom,

In recent episode I heard you mentioning that you need more questions. Finally I have one which is fantastic since I might hear your answer in the best technical podcast I've even listened. Thank you for you amazing work!

Question:

I'm wiring new house. Every room will have one or more ethernet sockets, all CAT6, all connected into a patch panel in garage.

I have absolutely no interest in more than 1 Gbps but I do want to have rock solid 1 Gb. How do I test and verify that the new sockets, patch panels and switches can do 1 Gbps?

I'm not professional and I don't have advance ethernet testers like Fluke Network. And I'm definitely not going to buy it since I need to test approx 50 ethernet ports and then I'm done with it.

I do own a simple tester that can reveal shorts and disconnected wires but that's not enough...

I want to use what I have available which in my case are two Intel NUCs gen 10. Based on my understanding NUCs can easily run 1 Gbps full duplex which for example Raspberry Pis cannot and therefore they should be great little testers.

The question is what software under BSD or Linux should I use?

I want to know if the cable can do 1 Gbps full duplex without dropping packets. The easy answer would be iPerf but I would prefer something simpler that can also show me if the connection is dropping packets, not just maximum speed. I don't want to read through pages of text in terminal since doing that for 50 ports would be tedious. Ideally I would execute some testing software, wait for example 60 sec and then get green for no packet loss and maximum speed, amber for degraded speed and red for not working. And all that without scrolling lines of text in terminal. Do you know about software like that?

Thank you BSD crew!

Best regards,

Carl
