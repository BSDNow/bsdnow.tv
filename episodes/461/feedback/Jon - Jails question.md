Hi guys. Quick questions. Under Linux and something like podman, there is a process called conmon that monitors the container if its running. Do jails have anything like that? I want to run jails at scale without too many add ons.

Also, Linux containers have repositories of container configurations (like docker hub). Is there anything equivalent in FreeBSD for jails? Having some sort of jail recipe repository could be useful.

Thanks!
