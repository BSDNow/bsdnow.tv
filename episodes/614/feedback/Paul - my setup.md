Hello there! 

In your last episode, you mentioned you would like to hear about the personal blog setups! Here is mine for foo.zone:

KISS HA Setup using OpenBSD: https://foo.zone/gemfeed/2024-04-01-KISS-high-availability-with-OpenBSD.html
And there is a static site generator which generates the foo.zone content, which I wrote in Bash: https://foo.zone/gemfeed/2021-06-05-gemtexter-one-bash-script-to-rule-it-all.html

Many greetings,

Paul

And thanks for the great show!
