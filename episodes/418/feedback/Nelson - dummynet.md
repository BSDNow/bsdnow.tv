I passed on the link to Dummynet from this week's BSD Now podcast
to colleagues at the University of Utah FLUX project, and Center
for High Performance Computing. FLUX is all about network emulation,
and one of the team responded that Dummynet has been largely replaced
by TLEM, and supplied this link:

Its lead author is the Dummynet architect.

Thanks guys, for turning up new and neat stuff for BSD-Now!
