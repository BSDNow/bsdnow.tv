Dear BSDNow,

In response to your call for listener feedback on favorite episodes,
I've found that those that spread the word about new features (e.g.
OpenZFS 2 becoming standard in FreeBSD 13.0, OpenSSH supporting FIDO)
have been really helpful for me as a user of FreeBSD. Episodes that
discuss emerging technologies like CHERI (Episode 468) and RISC-V
(Episode 425) have been great introductions that prompted me to read
more about those subjects. I've also enjoyed interviews that discuss
fun, real-world application of BSDs, like the shell community that
Solene Rapenne administers (Episode 435) and Trenton Schultz's
robotics work (Episode 321). Of course, your interviews with
BSD-community celebrities like Kirk McCusick (Episode 278) and Theo de
Raadt (Episode 6) are ones I've sought out when I found your show
after they aired. Coverage of stories like "NASA Programmer Remembers
Debugging Lisp in Deep Space" (Episode 465) and "The 20 year old bug
that went to Mars" (Episode 437) are just plain cool.

Thanks for producing a great show!

--Sam.
