Hey y'all,

You asked for it - so here you go!
While I've listened to about every BSD Now episode, I can really recall few specific ones. However, there is this one cheesy catchy title that is hard to forget - The Cantrillogy, episode 181 (I did have to look up the number). Especially featuring DTrace again in the last episode just made me think of it again. Now given that Bryan and Adam have started this shiny new computer company named Oxide, still keeping the lights on in Illumos land, what could possibly be an excellent upcoming show? Interviewing both, of course - please please please! ðŸ˜„

Cheers ausm Ruhrpott!
Daniel
