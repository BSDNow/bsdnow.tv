Hi

Happy new year to you all.

Are there any BSD based solutions where the OS boots then runs from a RAM disk, ideally where some state is permanent on a ZFS file system(passwd /var) a la SmartOS? All my SATA ports are for storage and don't want to run from a USB stick. I would normally just use SmartOS but for whatever reason the kernel won't load on my integrated motherboard and CPU. NetBSD would be my preferred platform but I have no issue with FreeBSD.

Thank you for any advice.
