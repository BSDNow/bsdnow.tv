Hi,

A couple of shows ago, you mentioned a new BSD named ArisBlu was trying to take up the mantle of FuryBSD. ArisBlu is now dead, as well (https://blog.fivnex.co/2020/12/fivnex-is-changing.html). Kai, the guy behind ArisBlu and Fivnex, has tried to start multiple Linux distros and BSDs. His efforts included Ubuntu Lumina (which I was excited about), Ubuntu Pantheon, and Ubuntu i3. I'm all for people having goals, but after the 3rd project fails maybe it's time to focus on something else.

Also, there was a Linux distro that decided to go BSD. I don't remember the name. I think it started with H. They forked the NetBSD kernel and were rewriting a bunch of stuff to be licensed under GPL. Any news on them!

Thanks, Bennet
