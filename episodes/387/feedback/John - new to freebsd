Hi,

I'm new to FreeBSD. I've used Linux for a while. I installed GhostBSD on my laptop. When I'm using the desktop, it looks just like any Linux distro I've used. I'd like to learn more about the differences between BSD and Linux. What would you recommend for beginners who want to get started with BSD? 

Thanks.
