As you and the listeners are well aware - since you covered it a few months ago - the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) now also features a BSD Specialist exam. They also provide free study resources for their exams and currently have study resources for their Linux Essentials and LPIC-1 101 exam with the 102 exam being in development.

However, work is also underway to write the study resources for the BSD Specialist exam! And you can help! They are looking for contributors so it would be nice if some experienced listeners would help out either writing chapters for the online book or help the chapters written by others.

Best regards,
