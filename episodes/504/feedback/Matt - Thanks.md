Hey my name is Matt and I am a 20 year Linux user currently in the process of migrating to bsd. I appreciate your podcast. I used to listen back in 2016 on jb. I have a podcast but have not produced an episode in nearly two years. I'm also a single dad of three. So I don't always have a chance to do a podcast. But I am very much looking forward to talking about bsd as well as GNU and Linux when I am able to do a podcast again myself. I just wanted to tell you that I have started listening to your show again and find your bsd knowledge to be appreciated and of a great value to me while migrating. 

I am using freebsd and have found it to be overall very familiar. The handbook has been a great guide and the built in tools for editing rc.conf and other files is very nice as well. I am currently using rc3 because I am using a n5095 based system to get started. I am using gnome Wayland and am very happy with the massive amount of familiar applications. 

I will be honest however that over the years I have gained an appreciation for doing some tasks in the gui and doing them from the cli is fine but I have moments when I find myself thinking of a gui before thinking of a cli for a task. I have also considered an Illumos computing option but BSD beats all alternatives hands down on the desktop. Anyway I just wanted to say thank you for your show and I will stay tuned. -Matt
