As for your question about knowing where you dozed off etc, you develop a sort of sense for this over the years. There are also a few cues which can help.

For one, the podcast app on my iPhone has a sleep timer which I set to the end of the episode. If I finish the episode before dozing off, I normally have a distinct memory of this. If I don’t have a distinct memory, I rewind a few mins and, if necessary, a few mins more, until I get to the point where I don’t recognize the content any more, and finish while making my coffee.

Cheers, and keep up the good work!
