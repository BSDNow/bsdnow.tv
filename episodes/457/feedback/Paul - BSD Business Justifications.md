Hi Benedict, JT, Allan, and Tom:

I'm a data engineer at a mid-sized company dealing with a lot of financial data. There has been a recent push for consistency and security on our network - primarily using Windows and Ubuntu. Obviously I prefer *BSDs, but cannot come up with a good business justification to move us towards FreeBSD versus Ubuntu. Any ideas?

Paul
