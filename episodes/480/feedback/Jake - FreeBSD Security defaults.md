Hey BSD Now Folks,

Thank you for your awesome podcast!

I recently came across a page which criticises FreeBSD's security defaults and general development culture. The author does not seem like they do it because they hate FreeBSD or think it's terrible, but because they want to see it get better. I'm curious if you agree, disagree, or have any thoughts about what they have written, especially since many of the hosts are quite closely involved in the project.

This is the page in question: https://vez.mrsk.me/freebsd-defaults.html

Thank you, and keep up the great work!
