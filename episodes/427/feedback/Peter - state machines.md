Hi,

Sorry to bother you with the following topic but I do not know where to start else. I listen to your shows  often and know you know a lot about FreeBSD. So I thought you could give me some hints. Iâ€˜m interested in state machines and want to understand if (UML/Harel) state machines are used anywhere in the FreeBSD kernel?

Maybe you know that. Or know someone who knows?

Thanks,
Peter
