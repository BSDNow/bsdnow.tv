Hello Tom and Benedict,

Thank you for featuring my NetBSD on Pinebook pro article in BSDNow 557.

I enjoyed listening to people who knew what they are talking about going through the article, and learning from the (many) errors you uncovered.

I have a question, though: at the section re: PKG_SRC, you said "nonsense", and moved on, but I wasn't clear whether my mistake was the idea that *anything* needed to be done (with PKG_SRC or otherwise) in order to install packages, or if it was *what* I did to get packages to install that was incorrect.

(I have moved on from NetBSD on the Pinebook Pro to OpenBSD on a Thinkpad, or I would try a fresh install.)

I wonder what led to our different impressions of Pinebook performance. You're running an eMMC, not an NVMe, correct? Perhaps I lost the silicon lottery, misconfiguration something, or had unrealistic expectations.

Thanks and best regards,
Isa (@curiositry)
