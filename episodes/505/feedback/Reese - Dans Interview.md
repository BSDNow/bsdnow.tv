Love the interview! I miss him from the techsnap show. Love his blog too. Thank you guys so much for this show. My obsession with BSD helps me with other life issues. I recently started working again after two years away from health stuff. Maybe I can make enough money to come to a conference and meet all of you.

Thank you 73
