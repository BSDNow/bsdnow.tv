Hello,

I've been following your contents for a while, not too long, hope im not to starightforward. Your contents are informative and helpful.
A couple of days back when I removed kgpg, [pkg remove kgpg -y] I seem to have deleted all kde5. After reboot, sddm wasn't working, Ctrl+Alt+F1 didn't respond, couldn't get TTY console. I tried to edit out rc.conf and loader.conf to get tty to install kde, I couldn't.

However, I could still use changing boot envionment from zfs:zroot/ROOT/default to 'earlier release', I still couldnt get the sddm or tty to work in ROOT/default. Since edit was unsuccesssful in single user mode, I even tried [zfs set readonly=off zroot/ROOT/default] from 'earlier release' no progress, yet.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,
JJ
