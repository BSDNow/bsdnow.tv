Hi!
First of all, thanks for the show with very useful information and fun you put into it.
I wanted to mention that boxyBSD service mentioned in episode 620 was abandoned or cancelled in some other way.
This project's website is reverse-proxied to `fediverse`-something with correct TLS cert of that something, but my Firefox went ballistic when I tried to open iot for the first time.
Also there was a post of project maintainer that they stopped admissions in 2024:

Cheers, Anton.
