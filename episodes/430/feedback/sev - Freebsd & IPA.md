I hope you are all doing well. I am sending this email out to see what you or others suggest to use for Authentication on systems running FreeBSD. I am convert from Linux to FreeBSD now for a few years and I wanted to start migrating all my legacy systems over completely to FreeBSD. I am currently using FreeIPA to authenticate users but, I wanted to know if there was another type of service that was BSD specific. Any suggestions are appreciated.


Thank you all for what you do and keep up the great work,
