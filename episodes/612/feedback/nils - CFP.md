Hi,
thank you for the great episodes and especially the wonderful pre-shows that I get to enjoy as a Patreon supporter. In the last episode, you advertised the CFP for EuroBSD Con. I was considering offering a workshop on Ansible. However, I noticed that there was already a workshop on this topic in 2019. Do you think this would be a problem, and should I focus on a different topic instead? After Benedict mentioned that he wants to offer a workshop on awk, I got the idea to offer one on sed ðŸ˜‰

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Thank you for everything.

Nils
