Hi BSD Now team, I hope you're all doing well and are having a great start to 2024!

I'm currently about 10 minutes in to episode 539 and I'm afraid to say that I'm feeling quite disappointed by Tom's dismissive comments towards the non-FreeBSD BSDs such as "you should use DragonFly BSD if it's 2004", "I've never used it [NetBSD and/or pkgsrc]", and "you should use OpenBSD if you have an old PowerBook G4." 

Thankfully Jordan was around to give more context and opposing views, and I understand that some developers are not optimistic about the DragonFly project; but I can't shake the feeling that the community's flagship BSD podcast (which is an invaluable source of news, updates, and insight) should not be so dismissive of 3/4 of the BSD ecosystem. As Jordan mentioned, HAMMER2 has the potential to be a hugely significant part of the scene by being an advanced and modern FS without any of the licensing drama that has hampered ZFS adoption across the *nix space.

Benedict did well to temper some of these opposing views and it's appreciated. Not that I am a fanboy of any particular project - I hosted my production website on OpenBSD with httpd (thanks in no small part to mwl's brilliant books) for over a year before moving it to FreeBSD due to a Lua URL rewriting issue I wasn't able to resolve. I just didn't like the "vibe" that people so prominent in the BSD space would so quickly or publicly dismiss projects other than FreeBSD, and the work they do or the niches they fill.

Thanks for everything that you do and please keep up the good work!
