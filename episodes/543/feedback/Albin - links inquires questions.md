Thank you for a great show! I remember that you asked for links, inquires, questions in an earlier episode, so here I come!

Links
-----

I think Andy, creator and primary author of Oil Shell for Unix, has some really interesting thoughts regarding Unix system architecture. One good starting point for his thoughts is on the project's wiki that contains links to the relevant blog posts.

Inquires
--------

I think it would be very interesting if you covered the different capability systems that has been built into FreeBSD (Capsicum) or hardware (CHERI). It would be great if you got David Chisnall for a longer interview.

And lastly...

Questions
---------

Here's some questions what I've, but had problems finding fresh answers to. These questions is asked from the perceptive of a Linux user that is preparing for installing FreeBSD for desktop usage.

- What is the recommended way for doing FDE (full disk encryption) on FreeBSD? ZFS native encryption? Something else?

- Is it possible to boot from a FDE disk?

- Any other info you think is relevant if you're going to do FDE on your desktop computer!

Thank you again for a great show!
