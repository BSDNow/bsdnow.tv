Hi guys, congrats for the show and for keeping it going for soooooo long! I guess thats the most diffult part of it. 

Just one silly a question, what happened with all the integration done by IXsystem for FreeBSD and OpenRC? is this dead? Any plans or intention to continue it and to merge it?

Regards.

Santi
