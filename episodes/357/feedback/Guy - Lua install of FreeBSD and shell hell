Many times on the show you had mentioned that a lua installer would be nice. I agree.  I  was quite intrigued and started to write an installer for the hikari compositor.  A learning experience I continue to enjoy with Lua and FreeBSD. I have come to a better understanding of both. This is where I ran into "Shell Hell" . It turns out that there is 3n relationship between shells and config files (root, user, other) were each shell would have its own syntax. Since Lua is starting to be an integral part of FreeBsd ( loader and ZFS core), would not the next logical progression be to incorporate Lua as the shell and scripting language. As for the configuration files, Universal Configuration Language would fit the bill. Work in this area has been started with  "BSDLua Bindings" being presented a few years ago by Ivan Voras. This seems to have gone over like a lead balloon as some folks don't want to give up their 2 decade old scripts! Just think of the uniform toolbox full of small ,concise lua scripts to detect and then install devices. The user only needs to pipe them together.
