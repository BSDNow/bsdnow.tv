Hello BSD Now team,

THANK YOU for continuing the podcast and all the work you put in!
-it is much appreciated!!!

Watching Allans panel on Homelabs was informative.

While setting up a new lab-server I was browsing a lot of documentation and was introduced to the concept UCL, Universal Config Language. - Although I have used it many times without knowing 
Googling UCL doesn't give that many new sources, but I understand Allan and Michael W. Lucas are proponents. Is there a general consensus to make UCL the "standard" FreeBSD config-language? -and what is status?

BSD-regards
Tom Ludensen
