I've been looking at getting FreeBSD to support the new Apple T2 SSD/keyboard/trackpad as Linux does. Is there someone in the US who would be interested in a summer job implementing the changes needed (as documented in Linux code) to make this work? If you know anyone interested in this job please email mmfbsd@2e.com. Both skilled and students with a mentor wishing to try are welcome.
