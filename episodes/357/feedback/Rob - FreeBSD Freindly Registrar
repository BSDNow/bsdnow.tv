Allan and Benedict,

My current domain registrar uses Ubuntu.

I'd like to switch to a registrar who uses and/or supports FreeBSD (or any BSD).

On the FreeBSD commercial vendors page I see Pair Networks listed as a FreeBSD user.  Yet recent Netcraft reliable hosting company reports list them as using Linux.

Which domain registrars are FreeBSD's friends?

Happy days to you dudes.
