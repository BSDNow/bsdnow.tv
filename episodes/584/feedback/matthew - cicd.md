Hi all,

I wonder if you could cover some options for continuous integration testing on BSD in a future episode? AFAIK none of the major code hubs (GitHub, Gitlab, etc) support BSD OSes in their CI platforms. A while back I discovered Cirrus CI, a wonderful¹ alternative that supports FreeBSD. But I would be interested to learn of others. 

Thanks,
Matt

¹ Nothing but great things to say about Cirrus CI. Proactive maintainers, great docs, very fast execution environments, simpler config. 5 stars.
