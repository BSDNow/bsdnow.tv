I'm a Windows support tech and I want to learn more about BSD for my own personal homelab and hopefully add it to advance my career to a more *nix based position but I'm overwhelmed by the paths to take.
I wanting to see what is a good way to learn the basics for BSD and not focus on the semantics of the fork (like Free, Open, Net, etc.) and not have to read the whole giant Absolute *BSD books (sorry Michael) or on creating simulated domain or enterprise setups.
Should I look into the BSD certification material or am I stuck translating a Linux project to BSD and hope it's a fairly easy? (Like building a Jellyfin jail/B-hyve)?

Thank you and keep the up the great work on the podcast.
