Ended up finding what the issue was after searching through the
freebsd-arm mailing list archives.

https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=233391

As a suggestion, I like how openbsd has a txt file with some
guidelines on their ftp site:

https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.8/armv7/INSTALL.armv7

Maybe this is time for me to create a blog I guess. Not sure if
there's any platform you guys could recommend to use for this purpose?

Thanks
