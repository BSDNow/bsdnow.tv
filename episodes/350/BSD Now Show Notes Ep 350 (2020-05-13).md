### [How Unix Won](https://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/617189040564928512/how-unix-won)
+> Unix has won in every conceivable way. And in true mythic style, it contains the seeds of its own eclipse. This is my subjective historical narrative of how that happened.
> I’m using the name “Unix” to include the entire family of operating systems descended from it, or that have been heavily influenced by it. That includes Linux, SunOS, Solaris, BSD, Mac OS X, and many, many others.
> Both major mobile OSs, Android and iOS, have Unix roots. Their billions of users dwarf those using clunky things like laptops and desktops, but even there, Windows is only the non-Unix viable OS. Almost everything running server-side in giant datacenters is Linux.
> How did Unix win?

### [Check logs of central syslog-ng log host on FreeBSD](https://blog.socruel.nu/freebsd/check-logs-of-syslog-ng-log-host-on-freebsd.html)
> This blog post continues where the blog post A central log host with syslog-ng on FreeBSD left off. Open source solutions to check syslog log messages exist, such as Logcheck or Logwatch. Although these are not to difficult to implement and maintain, I still found these to much. So I went for my own home grown solution to check the syslog messages of the SoCruel.NU central log host. And the solution presented in this blog post works pretty well for me!

### [Understanding VLAN Configuration on FreeBSD](https://genneko.github.io/playing-with-bsd/networking/freebsd-vlan/)
> Until recently, I’ve never had a chance to use VLANs on FreeBSD hosts, though I sometimes configure them on ethernet switches.
> But when I was playing with vnet jails, I suddenly got interested in VLAN configuration on FreeBSD and experimented with it for some time.
> I wrote this short article to summarize my current understanding of how to configure VLANs on FreeBSD.

### [Using bhyve PCI passthrough on OmniOS](https://www.cyber-tec.org/2019/05/29/using-bhyve-pci-passthrough-on-omnios/)
> Some hardware is not supported in illumos yet, but luckily there is bhyve which supports pci passthrough to any guest operating system. To continue with my OmniOS desktop on "modern" hardware I would love wifi support, so why not using a bhyve guest as router zone which provide the required drivers?
