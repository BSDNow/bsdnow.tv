Hi all,

On last week’s show you requested positive reasons to switch to BSD, so I thought I’d write in with one positive data point about the BSD community.

I wrote an application I thought would be of use to others beyond myself, so I started to think about distro packaging. Ubuntu seems to have the largest mindshare these days, so I started the process of packaging it for Debian. If you’ve never tried to package something for Debian before, it’s a little like being repeatedly told your princess is in another castle. While I was still in the midst of this, a stranger filed a curious bug report against my project in which they indicated their platform was FreeBSD. In investigating this, I realized they were in the process of packaging my application for FreeBSD. My application ended up being packaged and shipped in FreeBSD by this helpful stranger before I was even halfway through the Debian process! For me, this interaction really showcased the generosity and friendliness of the BSD community.

Thanks,
Matt
