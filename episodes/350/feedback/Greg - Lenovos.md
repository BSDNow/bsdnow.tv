Allan, Benedict and JT,

My impression is that alot of *BSD users have Lenovo laptops.  Lenovo rated it critical issue, since it seems to fix an issue that could brick your thunderbolt port after 6-12 months of normal use.  It seems to effect to most recent Lenovo laptops (2017-2019(. The problem was linked to a bad firmware update last year which appears to wear out the thunderbolt controller's SPI-ROM that holds configuration.
