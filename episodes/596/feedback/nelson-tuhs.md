Nelson - 

The TUHS list yesterday (which I read this morning)
has two links to a new talk by Kirk McKusick about
the origins of the BSD daemon character:

It was a fun 40-minute watch, and a definite MUST SEE
for BSDNow buffs!

The second link has ``cleaned up'' audio, but is
in a format that my CentOS 7 workstation cannot
display; the first worked fine, and I had no
trouble listening to the audio.
