Hey Allan, Benedict, JT and Tom,

Happy (Chinese) New Year!

I'm very glad that you are featuring Plan 9 bits and pieces every once in a while on the show, and so I would like to take this opportunity to invite you and the BSD community to the International Workshop on Plan 9 ( http://iwp9.org ), which had been resting for a while and now comes back to life in the year of the rabbit - coincidentally, the Plan 9 mascot is Glenda the bunny after all. Let's take that as a good sign.
The workshop will take place in Toronto, Canada, at the University of Waterloo from April 21-23, and the call for papers is open right these days; more details are on the website. We are looking forward to seeing exciting contributions and will gladly welcome everyone interested in Plan 9 and the related OS development. Maybe it even fits well for Allan, being not too far away. ðŸ˜„

Keep on with the great show and see you soon at FOSDEM!
