Hey Benedict!

I listened to some of episode 568 "regreSSHion" on my flight home from Singapore.

There was a discussion about the mirror network and performance of some of the mirrors.

Please ask your listeners to report any performance problems to clusteradm@freebsd.org. We currently have about 15 sites in the CDN, with good coverage across most of North and South America, Europe, East and South-East Asia, southern Africa and Australia/Pacific. By the default, we send people to the closest mirror. We know that's not always the best mirror, but we don't always know what the best mirror is unless people tell us.

We're also looking for additional sites for better global coverage. Generous offers welcome. Ideally colocated with or near internet exchange points.

Thanks.

Philip
