Hello folks,

I heard Benedict mention that if the mailbag gets low, it makes you all very sad. So here are some questions I have had for a while:

* What graduate programs have faculty who are FreeBSD committers? I hear from time to time about people doing their MS or PhD on some FreeBSD-related topic, and I think this could be appealing to me. 
* The FreeBSD Project Ideas page lists an idea for bringing illumos' doors to FreeBSD: https://wiki.freebsd.org/IdeasPage#Solaris_Doors_IPC_Implementation . Can you help me figure out who wants this and why? I am a big doors enthusiast (https://github.com/robertdfrench/revolving-door) and I am intrigued about the challenge of bringing them to a new platform.

Thank you again for the show, and keep up the good work!
