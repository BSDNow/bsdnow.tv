Hey Benedict and Allan, nice podcast I enjoy each episode. I use FreeBSD as a desktop daily driver, although I often have to supplement with Linux for apps that are missing. So this is my question: flatpak has changed the Linux game for me and others in that we can use nearly any distro but still access apps that would be horrific or impossible to build otherwise. Spotify, Steam, VLC, Zoom, and so on. I've read on the forum that flatpak is hard to port to FreeBSD. But is it impossible? If there's a lot of work, wouldn't it be much less than maintaining all these packages independently? My technical grasp is limited, but from a user standpoint, flatpak would solve a host of limitations and stengthen FreeBSD's potential as a daily driver.
