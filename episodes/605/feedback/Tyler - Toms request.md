I like the idea of sharing the stack used for personal blogs, it's
interesting to see how other people attack problems. Per Tom's request:

- site: https://foxide.xyz
- Host OS: FreeBSD 14.2
- Web Server: Nginx
- Static Site Generator: SSG5 (https://github.com/fmash16/ssg5)
- Version control with Git
- Write Markdown in emacs

P.S. I really enjoy the show and the banter between the hosts. keep up
the good work!
