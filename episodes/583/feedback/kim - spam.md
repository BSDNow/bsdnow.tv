Dear The Pacific Sutera Hotelier Sir
My name is Hyeon-jeong Kim, and I will be staying at your hotel for my honeymoon from September 29 to 30, 2024. My reservation number is 1355402144.
I am very much looking forward to my honeymoon in Kota Kinabalu, and I believe that our stay at your hotel will be the highlight of this trip. With this in mind, I have a few requests:

1. I would be grateful if you could assign us a room with a good view and excellent condition. We would like to create special memories while enjoying beautiful scenery.
2. Please let us know if there are any special events or services for honeymooners.

We look forward to the unforgettable memories that you will provide for us as a couple, and we thank you in advance for your warm hospitality.
I would appreciate your reply.

Sincerely,
Hyeon-jeong Kim
