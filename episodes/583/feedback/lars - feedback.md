Hello, JT, Benedict, Tom, and Jason,

I notice that the show calls for feedback and questions each time and this last time Benedict bemoaned the fact that he had neither to read. I've sent in quite a few from my GMX address but rarely get a response, summer 2023 was the last time there was a response.  So that makes me wonder how many mails actually get through to feedback@bsdnow.tv

For variation, I'll try from GMail.   I mainly use GMX, as it seems to take forever to decommission this old GMail account.   Many of the more interesting people the show would want to hear from are going to be self-hosting e-mail so perhaps that is a concern, too.

Anyway, here is a possible link for the news, or other part(s) of the show:

"I most definetelly [sic] should (self-host)!"
