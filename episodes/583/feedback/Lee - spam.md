Hello,

I'm Lee Shau-kee, a Hong Kong business magnate, investor, and 
philanthropist. I'm the chairman and majority owner of Henderson 
Land Development, a property conglomerate with interests in 
property, hotels, restaurants and internet services. I gave away 
25 percent of my personal wealth to charity and I also pledged to 
give away the rest of 25% this year. I have decided to donate 
$2,000,000.00 USD to you. If you are interested in my donation, 
do contact me for more info. I will also want you to be part of 
my Charity Foundation once you receive this money so we can join 
hands together to help the needy. contact us via email:   
 
Warm Regard
Lee Shau-kee.
