Hi Guys,
  FWIW, there is good reason to fetch the code for the suckless dwm and friends instead of installing from the packages.  The idea is that all those tools can be patched and the shortcut keys are defined in a config header file.  So when customizing them you need the source so you can update/patch and recompile.  It's just the way Suckless does it.  Similar to Xmonad which is written in the haskell programming language and you configure it with haskell.  So the Suckless Software is minimalist and they are written in C and configured with a header file.  This is actually typical for tiling window managers and allows the user to fully customize their workstations.  With that said I never did understand why there was packages for these window managers since it's not easy to customize them which is expected by those using these.  Using the ports for these make better sense than packages.  As always I never miss a show and you never disappoint, keep up the good work.
