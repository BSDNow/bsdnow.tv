Hi Benedict and Allan,

First of all, thank you for your work on the podcast. I look forward to it every week.

I have had intermittent problems recently with Firefox and a Logitech C270 camera on FreeBSD. The camera usually works but it's the sound that sometimes breaks - either I can't hear others or they can't hear me. I suspect Firefox may have been at fault here but it may have been the microphone on the webcam, so I'm thinking of switching to using a headset with the motherboard microphone input.

So, my interview question for you is: What combination of hardware and software do you use for online meetings such as Google Meet?

Do you use on-board motherboard audio for your microphone and headphones? Or do you have a recommended external USB sound device?

Any browser preference? Does Chromium or Firefox work better for you for online meetings?

Thanks,
Karl
