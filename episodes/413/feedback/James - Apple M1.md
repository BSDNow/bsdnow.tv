Lokkak - apple m1
I’ve been trying for a while (December 2020) to locate someone able to code the driver for the NVMe driver in FreeBSD on the M1.

I had engaged Scott Lang to write the code in exchange for a donation to FreeBSD foundation. Then the public issue happened with the other driver quality that almost made it into 13.0-Release.

Is there someone else that has the experience to do this change? Could we make a call out on the show? 

Currently VMware esxi is in production for me on M1.

I can also loan an M1 Mac.

I’d really like to see FreeBSD join Linux, ESXi, and OpenBSD at the M1 party.
