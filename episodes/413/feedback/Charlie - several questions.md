Hei guys thanks very much for your podcast, veery informative one,my questions are those:1 Can you explain to me how to install FreeBSD on RockPro64 without the emmc card?
Can you talk about Illumos Distro and all variants?
I'd like to install MDB modular debugger on Freebsd on my lenovo laptop x250 but i can't have it with all the syscall like mdb -K
That's all for now
Ciao
