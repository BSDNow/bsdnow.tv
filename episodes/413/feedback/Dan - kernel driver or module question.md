Hello, BSD Now peoples! You keep asking for feedback and questions, so:

How does a kernel driver/module get from "I wish we had X" to "X added in Y.Z-RELEASE"?

I have a hardware platform with a currently-unsupported network stack but there are vendor-provided drivers in Linux and a really detailed spec sheet that the system integrator pointed to as being plenty to get moving. I know C, I have the hardware, and I have the spec sheet, but I don't have the wisdom to know how to get from dream to reality. What hurdles are typical to encounter? What sorts of timeframes are reasonable for a hobbyist? Besides our own docs, are there any books you recommend on the subject? Maybe there are some simple "hello world"-style driver/module tutorials? And if there are other important questions I'm not asking, what might those be?

Thanks and keep up the excellent work!
