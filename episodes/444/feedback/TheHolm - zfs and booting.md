One of my FreeBSD server boots from ZFS, pool it boot from was created ages ago and missing lots of ZFS features introduced after it was created. I afraid to upgrade it because I not sure what ZFS features is supported by FreeBSD boot loader. I do not want to drive server unbootable. Unfortunately I also can't find any documentation about what zfs features supported by boot loader. Can i use zst compression? Is pools with spacemap_v2 od draid supported and so on? Could you please point me where I can find such info ( aside of digging thorough sourse code)? 

One more question, what need to be readable  by bootloader. Only /boot?
