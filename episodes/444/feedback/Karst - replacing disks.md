Thanks for the great show! I listen to it in reverse order and
hopefully end up some day on episode one.

My question is about storage. I run a ZFS-based NAS with a mirrored
pool of two 4TB disks. I want to replace them with two 8TB disk and use
the 4TB ones in a machine built form spare parts for replication
purposes. Is it possible to stripe the 4TB ones to an 8TB storage
provider and buy a third 8TB disk and use them as a mirror of two 8TB
storage providers?

Have a nice day,
Karst
