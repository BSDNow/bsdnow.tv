Hi Allan and Benedict … and JT … and any-guest-it-might-be-present-at-the-time

I have a short question about WireGuard. This question is for both of you and also JT is welcom to answer it. Do you use WireGuard in any of your systems? Why yes/no?

Second related question. I haven’t seen any news about WireGuard getting into FreeBSD base system. Do you know if it will get there?

Thanks for the never-miss-a-beat show.

Best regards,
Bostjan
