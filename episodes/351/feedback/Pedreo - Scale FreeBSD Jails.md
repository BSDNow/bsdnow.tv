 Hi there,

Another question for ye. I regularly hear you speak highly of jails and I also use them in a basic way for simple tasks at home. Is there a robust way to scale jails similar to how Linux containers do without the need for some homemade bash script? Is Ansible the best route to take?

Thanks a mill and keep up the great show!
Peter
