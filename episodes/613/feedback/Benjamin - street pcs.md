Good afternoon (or whatever time it is when you read this),

I just finished listening to episode 604 because I'm usually a week or
so behind on my podcasts.
Anyway I normally don't have anything to share so I don't usually
write it, but I decided to respond to the question you asked at the
end of the episodes regarding street found PCs.
Yes, I have found, but never taken, PCs left on the side of the road,
for context yes I do live in America, currently in Texas.
I actually (unfortunately) live in a gated community that has far too
many rules (HOA) and was surprised to see a PC and monitor next to a
trash can one morning while walking the dog.
I know it was gone that evening when I walked the dog again, so it's
possible it was picked up with the trash or someone took it.
Anyway, I've been listening more or less from the very beginning and
enjoy the show while I'm working or driving to/from work.

Ben
