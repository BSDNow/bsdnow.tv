I'm interested in trying to ZFS encryption.  I thought a good place to
start might be the /tmp file system.  Additionally, I thought rather
than depending on the system to clean up /tmp on boot (which can
sometimes take awhile if I've put A LOT of junk in there), I could just
have a per-boot key.  Is that possible?

Do you have any suggestions for how to set this up?

Thanks for the great show,
/Malcolm
