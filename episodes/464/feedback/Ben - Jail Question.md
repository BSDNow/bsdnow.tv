Hello Benedict, Allan, Tom and JT

Thank you for the reply of my last question. I like to dig deeper into BSD and stumble over your names from time to time.

A interesting challenge approached me from the side and I see the chance to learn a little more about FreeBSD. I installed a tool with NodeJS. The tool accesses two files in the “/root/.tool” directory while starting.
When starting the tool directly, it works. When I try to start it with an rc script it doesn’t work. When I lunch the service whit help of daemon, it starts but it seems, it does not find the files in “/root/.tool”. 

It seems, a service has another view on the jail. Can you explain the difference between running a command from terminal and starting the same as a service?


Thank you for your great podcast
Ben
