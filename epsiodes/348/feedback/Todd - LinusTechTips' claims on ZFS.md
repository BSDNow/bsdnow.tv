Hi Guys,

just wondering if this video's findings is legitimate ..

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWjOh0Ph8uM

in short :.. he claims disabling arc cach is a good thing and will improve performance .. I dont see any scenario when this would be good..?

have you herd of any case where his complaint about latency between interrupt requests and cpu's is valid? 

it seems to me that this nvme array could overload the cpu.. but it seems more resable that disabling hyperthreading would correct this issue...


any thoughts ? or is this looking like a legitimate limitation of zfs queuing? 

thanks!
