From a posting on the TUHS list just now (Wed 17-Jul-2025), in a discussion of influential books in Unix:
I have "Software Tools In Pascal" and am hopeful that I will
soon get asked if I have anything I want for my upcoming birthday. "Software
Tools" will be my answer. Your commment about the age of these books is
something I concur with. I find them easier to read and understand than many
modern publications. The one modern publication that I have found to be both
fun and easy to read is Michael W. Lucas's "Ed Mastery" which has been written
with a sense of humor not present in many software books.

Congrats to Michael!
